Shadowmaster (Sep 12) [30503] i have REGEN, am sleepin, and in a heal room, hp and move regen seem ok, mana regen is seriously way to slow and should be looked at.
Delilmanduil (Sep 12) [ 1298] rank still allows itself to fall below 0 if a serf dies

Xaede    (Sep 18) [ 3002] when "holy armor" prayer runs out you get "Your shield of deflection has worn off"
Shadowmaster (Sep 19) [ 3014] deceive does not toggle correctly, once removed, it constantly tries to remove it rather than reapplin it, also, it automaticly runs out, and i think the blank line im seein is supposted to be the run out message
Shadowmaster (Sep 19) [ 3014] disregard my mana regen bug reports, i beleave soulsuck might be a vaild reason for mana regen being so sucky
Shadowmaster (Sep 19) [ 3014] after futher testing, im very sure the blank line is decieves run out message
Xastar   (Sep 19) [13691] Herm... a minor 'illogicality' in the midgaard asylum - the doctors at the top levels will heal me while I'm killing them. :p
Xastar   (Sep 19) [ 3014] I think the befriend skill don't work - I tried befriendly quite a lot of stuff - fidos, bears, snakes, lions, warthogs - they all don't get charmed. I have 13 Charisma
Xastar   (Sep 19) [ 3075] Errr... idiot of me - forget about that bug - I didn't practice it yet and thought I had doh
Xastar   (Sep 19) [ 1035] When charmies tries to walk away from you (their normal mob instinct to wander), they will keep bursting into tears. Perhaps if the charm system was coded slightly further to prevent them from moving once they're charmed, they won't cry so often
Shadowmaster (Sep 19) [ 3054] where command gives away demons using the decieve skill ;)
Shadowmaster (Sep 19) [ 3014] we need to fix it so gods dont lose there items to ground when they quit

Shadowmaster (Sep 19) [ 3014] I can both see and use saint eq, and i should not beable to use the other immortals kits, need to check into this
Xastar   (Sep 20) [ 1070] there are several doors that work weird in this mud - you open one side, and walk in, the door is closed on the other side. So you open it and walk out, and then you find it closed on the original side you started from
Xastar   (Sep 20) [ 1070] Could be intentional - can easily be done, but I doubt that's the case? Should I report such doors? Do post on the board if I should or should not, and I will.
Jeronimas (Sep 20) [ 3006] equipment was destroyed when I quit, not falling onto the ground
Xastar   (Sep 20) [ 3005] In reflection of my previous post about the 'present' thing, i've killed the booger beast approx 8 times before i figured out - present to omel, give to duke. There has to be a better way. (perhaps present should be present obj target)
Xastar   (Sep 20) [ 4475] Is the Holy Bank in Malathar supposed to be unusable? i can't withdraw/deposit balance there
Xastar   (Sep 20) [ 4463] the Guildguards in Malathar doesn't block ppl's access to the guilds - I entered all of them. Might need to be fixed
Shadowmaster (Sep 20) [ 3014] seems the deceave skill only works if ur not movin, should it not affect whats seen when you leave, enter, the room too?

Mythran  (Sep 22) [ 3096] Buffer Overrun Found.
Shadowmaster (Sep 22) [ 3014] Deceive, acording to the code, this gives sneak, however, sneak is not appied in game
Shadowmaster (Sep 23) [ 3014] deceive skill is addin something to my affections list, (the SPL: part) but its not listing it
Shadowmaster (Sep 23) [ 3014] norank toggle for who list no longer works for me
Xastar   (Sep 23) [ 3367] Standing "Under the Portcullis" in the Lord's Keep, I can "open north" and "open south" - both doors. When I move into the room that this 'north' door opens to however, I have to "open door" instead - same goes for the 'south' door.
Xastar   (Sep 23) [ 3009] It is possible to activate the guides if we're exiting the grid. If we die in the grid and enter "Welcome to Dibrova" - we will end up usually sitting or something. Typing assist will let you get a guide. Erm... I took a tour - since i never took it. 
Shadowmaster (Sep 23) [ 3054] I just pushed Klasth's mount south... should'nt he have gone with it being as hes riding it?

Shadowmaster (Sep 25) [20230] this prince john script is purgin my fire drake!
Shadowmaster (Sep 25) [20228] the 'okay' message on the fireball spell is really unneeded, as fireball spell itself always tells you the result
Jeronimas (Sep 27) [30501] Cannot rent unless you have 100 gold coins on hand
Shadowmaster (Sep 27) [10412] sanc staffs work on me, they should not.
Shadowmaster (Sep 27) [ 3014] i think you've reduced soulsuck way to much
Shadowmaster (Sep 27) [30503] due to low mana regen, demons relie on soulsuck to regenerate mana, more than 2 per corpse would be nice
Shadowmaster (Sep 27) [30503] Regenerate spell, affection seems pointless, maybe base it on the players level to improve it
Shadowmaster (Sep 28) [30503] killin stuff of the opposite align seems to damage my own alignment too much
Shadowmaster (Sep 28) [20202] ignor my bug report for soulsuck, tho low lev mobs could give a bit more mana
Shadowmaster (Sep 28) [ 3014] netherclaw spell is more a skill than a spell by the sounds of it (i cant get to the trainer atm so unsure)
Shadowmaster (Sep 28) [30510] cooo vamp eq!!!
Shadowmaster (Sep 29) [ 3014] for the ammount of mana netherclaw uses, it should last a lot longer, as it is, weakend flesh is better
Shadowmaster (Sep 29) [ 3014] and im pretty much positive this should be a skill and not a spell
Shadowmaster (Sep 29) [20202] removein my dualed weapon deactives netherclaw, which is only affecting my main weapon
Shadowmaster (Sep 29) [20232] Cleric Prayer, Winds of Reckoning, does not default to victim when none is offered and caster is in combat
Shadowmaster (Sep 30) [20232] removin any eq removes netherclaw, only weapon should remove it
Shadowmaster (Sep 30) [ 3014] The weight problem seems to be comming from putting either Liq Containers, maybe other containers, inside one another.
Jeronimas (Sep 30) [30503] water containers can change the weight of other containers

Jeronimas (Oct  1) [17625] Mage Guildguard in New Thalos blocks you from leaving the guild area but lets you inside
Kintsugard (Oct  2) [13664] Mobs receive exp from players when killing them. If a player goes back and kills the same that killed them, the player gets that inflated exp. ie, I just killed a mob that normally yields 1190-ish exp for the kill. Since I already killed this mob, I r
Kintsugard (Oct  2) [13664] Since I already killed this mob, I received 127702 instead.
Shadowmaster (Oct  2) [20219] Demon Spell: Rain of Fire - Err, doesnt seem to do anything
Shadowmaster (Oct  2) [ 3014] I could carry more as a lev 150 remort, than i can now, this is probably the same for the other immortals, might want to check the code
Kintsugard (Oct  2) [13683] The cleric NPCs are actually healing ME when I attack them

Shadowmaster (Oct 14) [20232] clerics: earthquake is better than demons: rain of fire

Xastar   (Oct 22) [17625] New Thalossave
Xastar   (Oct 22) [17625] Ugh - New Thalos's Mage Guild guard blocks you in the wrong direction (south). The guild is northwards, but it prevents you from walking back into the city instead
Shadowmaster (Oct 23) [17324] Vitality could be a bit stronger than what it is, Heal needs to be better than cure critic but worse than vitality,
Shadowmaster (Oct 23) [17324] Cure critic and Heal both need to cost a little more mana than what they do atm
Shadowmaster (Oct 23) [17355] Cure critic and Heal both need to cost a little more mana than what they do atm
