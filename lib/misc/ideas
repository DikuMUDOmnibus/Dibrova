Xastar   (Sep 17) [ 1100] Perhaps it would help if the help files were organized further - example - 'help skill kick', 'help spell treewak', 'help race elf', 'help class demon', 'help area dearthwood' - would help keep the confusion low
Xastar   (Sep 17) [ 1100] In a mud with so many features - help files needs to be numerous, and when that happens, conflicting words may cause it hard to find certain information
Xastar   (Sep 17) [ 1115] For fleeing, perhaps it would help the players to indicate which direction they fled in, and that could be indicated in bright colors. At the moment, when one flees, you get a room description, and you're not sure if you've gone east or west... etc
Xastar   (Sep 17) [ 3075] Colored prompts - they speed up the resolving of info when someone looks at the line. Red for health, blue for mana, green for moves, purple for vim perhaps - with a glance, you can tell what the figure for mana is. Don't have to scroll left right fo

Xastar   (Sep 18) [ 3005] Druid Skill - Greater Track - once you type a mob name, you're told where it is, and if you confirm you wish to go to the creature, you'll move straight to the creature room by room, no failures and without having to type directions - faster than nor
Xastar   (Sep 18) [ 3005] - cont - normal tracking
Xastar   (Sep 18) [ 3005] Druid Skill/Trait - Trackless Step - at certain levels, druids can't be tracked (taken from D&D)
Xastar   (Sep 18) [ 3005] Druid Skill/Trait - Timeless Body - at certian levels, druids don't age no more (taken from DnD)
Xastar   (Sep 18) [ 3005] Druid Skill/Trait - Venom Immunity - name speaks for itself - even I feel that this might be overpowered hehe - just an idea
Xastar   (Sep 18) [ 3005] Druid Spell - Instead of divine nimbus, perhaps the spell name can simply be replaced with 'barkskin' - or barkskin can be a separate spell which offers AC instead of damage reduction, or it can be a spell with reduces both a little... shrug
Xastar   (Sep 18) [ 3005] Druid Spell - Regenerate spells - spells that don't heal you right away, but will let you regenerate hit points over time. Druids don't get heals as powerful as clerics, so this as a replacement (eh - being a druid, please do let me keep a few heal s
Xastar   (Sep 18) [ 3005] 'skill' and 'spell' commands - which shows what your class can do, can perhaps be included to show other classes (skill cleric, spell cleric, skill thief, spell sorceror - etc)
Xastar   (Sep 18) [ 3005] Druid spell/skill - Detect Poison should perhaps be added as a druid spell - or anything else poison/venom related. Poisons come from the wild (assuming Dibrova don't have toxic waste generating plants yet) - hence could perhaps be a druidic knowledg
Xastar   (Sep 18) [ 3005] Ranger/Thief - Envenom Weapon could be a thief skill - (if it is not already) - a percentage of chance that the person envenoming a weapon will poison himself instead of applying the blade (reflecting that the stuff is dangerous) - Unless he is a dru
Xastar   (Sep 18) [ 3005] Unless he is a druid also, then he doesn't get a chance of getting poisoned - it makes it a totally ranger ability (combining two class' abilities) - the druid could perhaps cast a spell to remove or reduce this chance of self poisoning
Xastar   (Sep 18) [ 3074] Magical Druid Jars - The commands Mix, Herb, Sprinkle, Imbibe could perhaps be given a nicer 'feel' through the usage of the words 'Druid Infusions' instead of druid jars. Everything can simply stay the same - the jars stay but instead of the command
Xastar   (Sep 18) [ 3074] 'mix', the command 'infuse' could be used. Instead of 'sprinkle'ing the ingredients in, you could 'mix' them in instead. Mix the ingredients into the jar one by one, and finish off by infusing it with magical powers.
Xastar   (Sep 18) [ 3074] The Imbibe command is great the way it is. Could be confusing to old people who used it regularly, but the feel would be better perhaps.
Xastar   (Sep 18) [ 3074] Perhaps the idea/typo/bug commands should be increased in the length it can be entered in :p I find myself separating an idea/typo into two three pieces - coz there are details to be included... hehehe
Xastar   (Sep 18) [ 3005] Entangle - the classical druid/ranger spell - allows one to entangle a creature with plants etc so that it is immobile. In mud terms, three possible applications :
Xastar   (Sep 18) [ 3005] Entangle - one - if creatures here track down their attackers and whacks them, entangle will render them immobile while the attacker makes a getaway. (fog mind renders this useless hehe)
Xastar   (Sep 18) [ 3005] Entangle - two - Or, the opponent is held immobile (no attacks) for a round or two or more this could be an often used spell by druids/rangers - even high level ones - coz everyone wants to save a few hps. :p
Xastar   (Sep 18) [ 3005] Entangle - three - As it is used by mobs at the moment - disallows a mob from fleeing although attacks happen as normal. Makes more sense than paralysis, since paralysis is supposed to be total numbness or something
Xastar   (Sep 18) [ 3005] Entangle - It could be all three of that put together making entangle one very interesting spell. Esp if mobs use it against players hehe :p - errr... perhaps mob usage of it could be toned down if the second component kills of too many players heheh
Xastar   (Sep 18) [ 3005] Never liked the way the cleric spells went from cure to heal, and from light to moderate. Perhaps one list using just 'heal' would be good - minor, light, moderate, serious, critical, massive. (Taken from DnD - except for massive hehe)
Xastar   (Sep 18) [ 3014] Druid Spell - feline eyes (or cat eyes) - same as infravision, just name given flavor. (I also feel that the Cat's Eyes potions should be renamed. Cats see in the dark, they don't see invisible stuff. Ethereal eyes could perhaps be better for see inv
Xastar   (Sep 18) [ 3014] invis potions?)
Xastar   (Sep 19) [ 3075] Making Practices Valuable - remaining practice sessions a high level character has can perhaps be used towards increasing their hp, mana, vim, qi, moves etc... - five pracs for 3 hp, 3 mana and 5 moves was the standard at my other mud.
Xastar   (Sep 19) [ 3014] Druid Skill/Spell - Mark/Trail - Druids can have the ability to mark rooms/locations. Can be made as a spell so that it makes more sense - they create small objects on the floor with unique identifiers which cannot be picked up
Xastar   (Sep 19) [ 3014] Druid Skill/Spell - Mark/Trail cont - The objects can be identified by color or numbers or (if possible) even let the druid type a name (A wooden marker which says room 1 have been left here)
Xastar   (Sep 19) [ 3014] Druid Skill/Spell - Mark/Trail cont -  These can be left as a trail while they are traveling - for ppl to follow or to find their way through mazes and the like. (Truly difficult mazes can still be made tough by disallowing use of this spell in it, o
Xastar   (Sep 19) [ 3014] Druid Skill/Spell - Mark/Trail cont -  or destroying the markers the moment they're created - !mark/!trail rooms)
Xastar   (Sep 19) [ 1035] Charmies could perhaps be labelled as such. Sometimes, ppl won't know a creature is your charmie. Placing (charmed) in front of its name or simply replace the whole thing with 'creature name is currently following character name' would perhaps help
Xastar   (Sep 19) [ 3014] Vim can perhaps be based on Charisma instead of Intelligence - an examination of the races recommended for rangers and druids are ALL low on intelligence. This will result in low powered druids who quickly runs out of spell power. Why Charisma?
Xastar   (Sep 19) [ 3014] From DnD : Charisma measures a character's force of personality, persuasiveness and personal magnetism. The force of personality part might fit in. And druids involve charmies too through their befriending of creatures of the wild... A charming thief

Xastar   (Sep 20) [ 3014] A public/private journal system - where players can write up stuff which other players can see (thru the finger command perhaps), and also record down stuff - Sorta like at the moment, I've given Pon two manes, and have given Omel two coins, and I wa
Xastar   (Sep 20) [ 3014] I wanna note it down somewhere - goes into the private journal. Stuff like my plans and thoughts blah blah goes into public journal that everyone can see. Either one will do actually :p Or both hehe...
Xastar   (Sep 20) [ 1031] Perhaps for all quests, the items must all must be 'presented.' This will stop players from making mistakes. (giving away a quest item to some mob and having to kill the mob.) I gave noses of booger beasts to omel, pinkies to the wrong constables and
Xastar   (Sep 20) [ 3301] Erm... using tells while moving can be slightly frustrating, mainly because the color of blood stains and tells are the same. So responding to those may be a problem while your actively doing things. Bright green is the most neutral color for tells..
Xastar   (Sep 20) [ 3301] Giving players the option to change the color is hard, but may be the best solution.
Jaelle   (Sep 23) [ 3025] 27
Xastar   (Sep 24) [12501] Help files - for the help file for areas - using numbers (help area 10) instead of just help name might help. "Old Tree" would interfere with "Old Mountains" and "Tree of Life"
