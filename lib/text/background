Dibrova was created by Rodger and Kaan in an attempt to create a more 
player-friendly environment than most common muds offer. After playing
on a number of muds, experiencing the lack of immortal courtesy that
seems to be the norm for most muds, we (Rodger and Kaan) got fed up
enough to actually begin construction on a completely new mud. The going
is slow for us, as we both have extremely full time jobs, and so although
construction for this mud began sometime around November of 1997 and we 
are still not even close to player ready as of June 1998, we feel that
our progress is acceptable.

One of our main goals in the creation of this mud is to make as many new
zones and commands for the player as possible. Player feedback for any
zone or command that seems new or out of the ordinary is very much
encouraged. This is Kaan's first mud he has ever built on, these are his
first zones ever made. Rodger has had some experience coding for other
muds, but as a full time coder, this also is his first shot. Be patient,
and remember, your feedback is encouraged!

Now go have some fun!

Rodger and Kaan.
