ALIGNMENT

Alignment is the scale of measure that the game uses to judge how Good
(Lawful) or Evil (Chaotic) you are as a player.

A numeric scale from -1000 (as evil as you can be) to 1000 (as Good as you
can be) is used to interpret which alignment you are.

The following text definitions are used on the score screen at the following
amounts per alignment scale:

  Saintly           ----->  750 or abovep
  Good              ----->  350 to 750
  Neutral           -----> -350 to 350
  Bad               -----> -350 to -750
  The Devil's Spawn -----> -750 or below

Alignment can be changed by fighting creatures of opposite alignment to
the one you wish to obtain.

Alignment will affect your ability to wear certain pieces of equipment if
that equipment is flagged as such. The Paladin and Dark Knight classes are
unable to cast their spells if they are not above or below the Neutral
designation (350) - above or below depends on which class - as their primary
source of mana comes from their worship of the Gods of Good and Evil.

AC "ARMOR CLASS"

"AC" is your armor class.  It is a number from -10 to 10, roughly
defined as follows:


  AC  Roughly equivalent to
-----------------------------------------------------------
  10  Naked person
   0  Very Heavily armored (Plate mail, and "two shields") 
 -10  Armored battle tank

The score command displays your armor class as a number such as 78/10;
this means 78 on a scale from -100 to 100 (i.e., 7.8 on the scale from
-10 to 10.)

#
AUTOQUEST

A small complex of rooms lie one room up from the Temple Altar in Midgaard.
Each room holds a Questor who will assign quests depending on your level.

To see what quests the questor offers, type 'list'. 
To begin on one of the quests, type 'join (quest #)'.

Most quests can not be repeated, prizes for each quest are given immediately
upon completion of the quest. Prizes can be quest points, gold, experience,
or eq - or a combination of two or more of those things.

Many quests are level restricted - if your level does not fall within the
particular quest's criteria, you will be unable to attempt that quest.

If at any time during a quest you feel that you are unable to complete the
quest, simply type 'fail' in the presence of a Questor and you will be able
to join a different quest. Logging out *will not* make it so that you can
join a new quest, you *must use the fail comand*.

BOARDS

Bulletin boards are the forum of inter-player communication on the MUD.
There are different bulletin boards for different purposes -- for example,
a standard mortal board, a board for immortals, a board for fun "social"
messages, etc.  Naturally, not all players may be allowed to read all
types of boards.

Type "LOOK BOARD" to see the messages already posted on a board.  Type
"WRITE <subject>" to post a message to a board; terminate a message with
a '@' as the first character on a line.  Type "READ <number>" to read a
post.  Type "REMOVE <number>" to remove your own messages.

Example:

  > look at board
  > write Am I using these boards correctly?
  [writes the message; terminates with a '@']
  > look at board
  > read 6
  > remove 6

CLAN CLANS

Clans can be established through an immortal at any time during 
gameplay. There is no fee to begin a clan, the only criteria that
must be met is:
- There must be at least one level 50 LEADER to establish the clan
- There must be at least six members to start the clan and the
  clan must keep at least six active members at all times for the
  clan to stay active. Any clan that runs short of the minimum amount
  will be disbanded until such time as membership can meet the minimum.
- A clan starts out with a name only (a spiffy title by their name)
  and nothing else. All other amenities available to clans other than
  the name must be purchased.
- Additional item for clans can be purchased for prices which are 
  outlined in HELP CLANPRICES.

The purpose of a clan is to allow players to interact with other
players in an attempt to benefit the group in raising financial
and material wealth that can be of use by the entire clan. Clans can
also provide a basis for fighting groups to be formed for easier
interaction between players which, in some circumstances, would not
normally be had.

Clans may purchase room(s) to build themselves a Clan Hall or whatever
they may wish to call it. All clan rooms are to be written by a
CLAN DEVELOPER or LEADER and submitted to the immortal who is handling
the clan's development.

Clans may purchase control of a town (hometowns excluded) or zone.
Upon purchase of a zone, the clan immediately is given the right to
PKILL any member of any other clan who sets foot upon their territory.
*Appropriate warnings will be placed so that players know when they
are in a clan's territory.
*The exception to this rule would be if a player were a DIPLOMAT from
another clan, allowing that player diplomatic immunity from attack.
*Players who are not part of any clan will not be permitted to be
attacked through the CLAN PKILL policy.

PLEASE NOTE: Once a clan is created, it stays an entity (as a name) on
             Dibrova forever. Even if no members belong, the name still
             exists. In the event that the max number of clans is created
             players who wish to create new clans will have to choose
             from names of inactive clans. Our max number of clans is 20.

#
CLANRANKS

Clans are allowed the following ranks and priveleges of each upon 
creation. These are the ONLY ranks available to clans, and the 
specified amount(s) for each ranked stands fixed.

LEADER -    These are the players who purchase and make the rules for
            each clan. They set the policies for the clan, they are the
            only players in the clan that an immortal will deal with
            when discussing clan development.
            * There can be three leaders to a clan, due to the fact 
              that it will normally take more than one player to come 
              up with the gold it takes to begin one. Three is the 
              limit, there does not have to be three, it is simply 
              the max number of leaders allowed.

DEVELOPER - These are the players who are just below the LEADERS in
            rank. A player would be given this honorary position if
            if he/she were the one who created the zone or rooms for
            the clan and was not a LEADER. There can only be two
            DEVELOPERS per clan.

DIPLOMAT -  This is the player that speaks for the clan when offering
            trades of eq or challenges of war to other clans. This is
            the only type of player in a clan that may pass through
            another clan's zone without fear of attack. There can
            can only be one diplomat per clan.

TREASURER - Most LEADERS will prefer to handle the funds of the clan,
            however if they choose not to, this is the post that the
            LEADER may assign the clan member who will. There can only
            be one treasurer per clan.

RECRUITER - The recruiter is the only type of clan member other than
            the LEADER who may induct other players into the clan.
            A RECRUITER may not change a member's rank, only induct.
            There can only be three recruiters per clan.

CLANPKILL CLANWARS

Clan members may only pkill during regular gameplay if a member of 
another clan trespasses in a zone that is owned by a different clan.

Clan wars may be had by requesting it from an immortal and setting up
time for the war so that as many members from each side may be present.
Wars must be reserved at least a day in advance through an immortal,
minimum entry is 500k per clan. Winning clan may have the money or
equivalent in clan advancements. Upon time of the war's beginning,
all members of both clans are loaded into two prep rooms, one for each 
clan. Notice will be given when the exit to the room is opened and
the battle is to the last man standing.

CLASSES

Each player has a class.  A class (sort of like an "occupation")
determines many characteristics of your player.  The skills and spells 
you will be able to learn, what equipment you can wear are in part determined
by your class.  Additionally, certain limitations and/or priveleges are given
to various classes.

Dibrova offers several classes for players.  These classes are broken down
into categories of Casters, Healers, Rogues and Fighters.

 Casters: Sorcerer, Dark Knight
 Healers: Cleric, Monk
Fighters: Gladiator, Paladin
  Rogues: Thief, Ranger

See also: SORCERER, CLERIC, THIEF, GLADIATOR, RANGER,
          DARK KNIGHT, MONK, PALADIN
#
CLERIC

Clerics have an ancient belief in not carrying sharp weapons.  Hence, they can
only wield bludgeoning weapons.  This class gives you the wisdom of peace,
blessing and healing, though it is possible to learn more violent prayers.

A cleric's magic comes in the form of prayers.  Use the "Pray" command
to use a prayer.

You can improve your skills and prayers by using the practice command.

See 'skills' for a list of skills available.
See 'prayers' for a list of prayers available.

#
DAMROLL

Damroll is an added bonus for players during combat.  It measures
a player's ability to hit with extra force.

See also: HITROLL, SPELLPOWER
#
DARKKNIGHT "DARK KNIGHT"

Dark Knights are the class exactly opposite of the Paladin class.  Their
goals in life are toward personal gain and causing misery upon those around
them.  They do not believe in Chaos as a rule, as they are a very organized
military class.

Dark knights, like Paladins, get the benefit of both spells and skills as
their main strength comes from their strong belief in the Gods of Evil.

You may see a list of skills and spells by typing 'skills' and 'spells'.

#
DWARF DWARVES DWARVEN

Dwarves are a short, stocky race who tend toward brawling and drinking.  They
are a surly race, usually short tempered and not always very smart.  They
are good with metal, being expert smiths.  They prefer living underground,
in caves or he equivalent, but can just as easily adapt to city life above
ground.

Dwarves are best suited to the Gladiator class, but can be effective rangers
if played wisely.
#
ELDAR

Eldar are very humanoid in appearance, one would almost mistake one for a
human, except for the fact that every Eldar has an extra two fingers on
their right hand.  Some say that these extra fingers are the reason they
are such natural spell casters, it would help with some of the more complex
gestures associated with casting.

Most Eldar are put into the Academy at Loxlane at an early age, sometimes
as early as age three.  This also helps to make them a bit more proficient
in later years with spell casting.

Eldar, like elves, can grow to be a very old age, unaffected by the years
as humans might be.  An average life span for an Eldar is around 175 years.
#
ELF ELVES 

Elves as a race are sometimes considered by outsiders as snobbish, or haughty.
The truth is, they simply desire to be left alone to do their own thing.  They
do not feel any sort of animosity toward other races, they just prefer
seclusion.  Their natural habitat is in the woods, with or near other elves.
They frequently build their homes in the trees, carving a life out of the
wilderness around them.

Elves have a natural affinity toward the spell casting arts, and are a
naturally agile race.  Elves tend to make good thieves, sorcerors, and
rangers.

Elves have natural infravision.
#
ELVEN TREE CITY

The Elven Tree City is exactly what its name implies - an elven city in
the trees. It lies well hidden to the east of the Rahn Grasslands, far from
human influence and trouble.

Though this city boasts all of the amenities of a large city, it is by no
means a large city - indeed with most of the city being in the trees and
most of the area belonging to private residents, this is definately not a
city concerned with tourism. The elves would, in fact, rather be left alone
even if it means no added gold for their merchants' coffers.

This town is well suited for any elf, tailor made for the class, the town
and all within it revolving around the Lore, the Elven belief that all
that has come before gives power to the now and can make magic for those
who wield the now with wisdom. There have been known to be a few mortals
of other races who have attempted to live among the elves of the city, some
have even succeeded - but there have also been those who have had unfortunate
accidents... be careful in what town you choose.
#
EXPERIENCE XP

Whenever you kill a monster or a player, you earn experience points.  When
enough experience points are earned, you raise a level.
Things you should know about experience points:

  * When damaging a monster, you get experience points.

  * If you kill a monster of higher level than yourself, you get bonus
    experience points.  If killing a monster of lower level you'll gain
    less experience points

#
FLAGS

Players sometimes have FLAGS after their names in the WHO list.  These
flags are always in parentheses, not brackets or braces.

  FLAG        MEANING
  ----------- ---------------------------------------------------------
  (KILLER)    Player is trying to kill other players.  That means you
              can try to kill him/her without being flagged.
  (THIEF)     Player is trying to steal from other players.  Fire away.
  (invis)     Player is invisible; you can see him/her because you are
              sensitive to the presence of invisible things.
  (writing)   Player is writing on the board; do not disturb.
  (mailing)   Player is writing mail; do not disturb.
  (deaf)      Player has chosen not to hear shouts.
  (notell)    Player has chosen not to accept tells.
  (quest)     Player is participating in a quest currently being run by
              the Gods.
  (arena)     Player is in the arena, fighting other player(s)

#
GIANT

Giants are extremely tall, as you may have guessed, and very strong.  Oddly
enough, they are usually a good-tempered, gentle race who have a very good
reputation in Dibrova.  The average height of a giant is seven foot, six
inches making them seem menacing to folk who do not know any better.

Giants make great gladiators, with their superior strength, but can also
make good rangers, as they have high constitutions to go along with their
strength.
#
GRID

You can only access the Grid through using the GAIN command at your guild.
In the Grid, you cannot heal nor use protective magics. There are ten
mobs within the Grid every time you enter, their level dependant on your
own. All mobs, upon death, will transfer to you a single quest point.
Quest points can be used at the quest shop to buy eq, trade for gold,
buy strong potions, as well as other things.

The Grid is flagged ARENA, so death in the Grid will not cost any exp
and will not take your eq away.  If at any time you wish to leave the
Grid before death, you may use the END command to do so.
#
GUILD

The Guildhouse is the place where mortals may go to escape the troubles and
perils of a cruel world.  Each guild is heavily guarded, so that only members
may enter the building.  Guilds are also the places where people come to
learn and practice the skills of their trade.

See also: PRACTICE
#
HALFLING

Halflings are short, sneaky folk who tend to mesh in with city folk very
well.  They love to try and get away with all your money if they can,
whether through coersion or outright thievery doesn't matter.  They make
shrewd businesspeople, usually becoming very rich in short spaces of time.

Halflings make good thieves, adequate spell casters, and TERRIBLE knights
of any kind.  Their small stature makes them poor fighters in any capacity.
#
HITROLL

Hitroll is a bonus applied to player stats that measures the improved
ability to strike an opponent during combat.  Hitroll can help a player
connect more often with attacks.

See also: DAMROLL, SPELLPOWER
#
HOMETOWNS

Hometowns are a predesignated zone that will set where a player will load in
the game when using scrolls of recall and upon game entry.  A player's
hometown is initially set at the time of character creation but can be
changed during gameplay if an imm is given a good enough reason to do so.
Players will only donate objects to their hometown's donation room - there
is a donation room in every hometown.  This way players will be helping
their fellow townsmen along in their gameplay and not some sorry, pathetic
excuse for an adventurer from some other town.

Town meetings can be held (at the players' request) monthly at either the
Town Meeting Hall or any square designated by an immortal.  Each town will
have its own immortal sponsor who is responsible for the upkeep of the town
and any general needs or desires the players as a populace may have.
Players may become Town Mayors and run the meetings themselves but only
after reaching level 50 and only through a public vote where every member
of the town will have a say.  Even then the immortal sponsor will probably
be present at the meetings just as an observer.

Hometowns are much like clans - they can be added to for a price, they can
provide a starting point for players to make friends in Dibrova.  They can
also be a way to inherit enemies from rival towns who despise anyone from
your town - so choose wisely!

/ccHometowns currently available in Dibrova:
/cb
Elven Tree City
Jareth
Malathar
McGintey Cove
Midgaard
Ofingia
Silverthorne/c0

#
HOUSES

Houses have been implemented as of CircleMUD 3.0.  A house entails two things:
access control and crash protection.  Only you and your guests will be allowed
to enter the house.  Your house will be crash-saved every five minutes.  You
can force your house to save by typing 'save' while standing in your house.
In the event of a crash, the objects in your house as of the last crash-save
will be loaded back into your house when the MUD reboots.  Also, if you own
a house, and quit from the game while standing in your house, you will be
loaded into your house next time you enter the game.

Guests of your house can be defined using the HOUSE command.  See HOUSE for
more information.

Houses are an alternative to renting.  You can simply enter your house and
quit; your objects will drop to the ground and be crash-saved for when you
return.  There is currently no limit to the number of objects which can be
stored in your house.  Of course, players must expect to pay a much higher
premium for the convenience of houses; contact your local Implementor for
a fee schedule.

#
HUMAN

Humans are the basic 'all-around' race.  Their abilities do not usually sway
heavily in one direction or another, rather they are moderately good at
most every aspect of the game.
#
IDENTIFY

Identify is not a command that is usable without the aid of magic. To use
this option, a player must have a magical item such as a scroll of identify
or equivalent.

i.e., (with a scroll) RECITE IDENTIFY <obj> or <mob>

When attempting to identify an object, a player must either be wearing the
object or have it in their inventory. The first item that is checked when
using an id is actual equipment worn, so if you are holding a helm and
wearing a helm and type 'REC ID HELM' it will id the helm on your head,
not the one you are holding. Be sure to use the least common alias for
the object you are attempting to identify to avoid wasting scrolls.
#
IMPLEMENTOR

The most powerful being in existence.
#
INN INNS CRYOGENIC CRYO RECEPTION

Inns are places where the weary traveler may rest while the innkeeper looks
after his equipment and treasure.

Specifically, the game will save your equipment while you are logged out.
There is a daily cost for renting, based on your equipment.  Each item has
a per diem charge.  The per diem charge is calculated to the nearest second,
however -- if you rent at the rate of 2400 coins per day, and you come back
39 hours later, you will be charged 3900 coins.

A CRYOGENIC CENTER will store your items for a one-time charge of four
days rent.

Rent files are deleted if you run out of money to pay the per diem charges
or after 30 days.  Cryogenic-rent files are deleted after 60 days.

#
JARETH

Jareth is the city of Dibrova that would be considered the 'capitol' if
there were a capitol for Dibrova. The Lord of Jareth, who is considered by
the common folk to be the protector of the land and of all things good,
dwells in Lord's Keep within the city limits of Jareth.

Jareth has all the amenities of a large city with a few added bonuses.
There is a casino on the boardwalk where gambling is allowed and a
bloodbank on Worship Way that will purchase your blood for a nominal fee.
There is a slew of good eq and the potions sold in Jareth are rivaled only
by those sold in the bazaar at McGintey.
#
KENDER

Kender are a very small, sneaky race tending toward the thieven arts and
pranks of any and all sorts. Kender usually don't grow much over four and
a half feet, they have small, pointed ears and usually go through life
with a big, sloppy grin on their face.  They shy from physical labor,
making their money the old fashioned way, and love to dance and party.

Kenders make great thieves most of all, but can be adequate rangers when
it suits them. 
#
LINK

A lot of players have problems with their links to the game.  This can be
very hazardous to your health in the middle of a battle, of course.

 I. If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee each
    time someone attempts to hit you.  If you manage to flee, then you
    will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until you
    reconnect to the game.

II. If your link jams (freezes), you have a problem.  The only solution we
    can give is that you break your link as quickly as possible.  By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

    Do not try to get out of a fight by breaking link.  You will be not
    reimbursed for any experience or equipment if you purposefully
    cut your link.
#

OFINGIA

Ofinigia began as a quiet farming community some few years back. Over time,
word of their fertile soil spread across Dibrova and fers seeking prosperity
migrated toward the small town, slowly adding to its population until it
became a city in its own right.

Unaware that a goblin horde dwelled south and west of the city, the townsfolk
continued to develop the area until one day the goblins in the area began
making forays into the farmlands nearby, ransacking the fields and killing
off any people they found therein.

Since that fateful day, the town has been under constant siege, fighting the
horde in countless battles in attempts to eradicate the threat. The Lord of
Jareth even sent reinforcements to help to bolster the defense of the town,
but to no avail - the goblins number too many to be driven off quickly not
to mention the caverns in which they dwell are many and winding, easily
hiding them when the need arises.

And so the once peaceful farming community now battles the goblins, their
gates always closed and their people always on full alert.
#
NEWBIE

Hi there, and welcome to Dibrova.  The following is a basic run-down of
commands and options available to newbies on Dibrova that will help you get
started.  Some of these commands will only work until you reach a certain
level, others you will find useful for your entire stay in Dibrova.

Any of the following commands can be further explained by typing HELP and
the command name afterward.  This list is simply a generalization of what
each command will do.

NEWBIE - This is a command that can only be used in the presence of a
Newbie Helper, who is always located in your initial loadroom.  By typing
this command in their presence, you will instantly be teleported to the
Newbie Headquarters which leads to all of our five newbie areas.

RECALL - This is a command which is free to newbies through level 10 which
will instantly teleport you back to the last place you rented or loaded in
the game - it will always be in a safe, or PEACEFUL room.  Recall will not
work during a fight, and after level 10 requires a potion, spell, or scroll
to be used.

GAIN - This is the command you must use in order to gain levels as a player
on Dibrova.  It can only be use in the presence of your guildmaster and only
if you have the required experience points needed to raise another level.

PRACTICE - This command must also be used when in the presence of your
guildmaster, it will allow you to practice skills and spells that will
help you to better vanquish your foes in Dibrova.

SCORE - This will tell you all of your vital statistics and then some.
Much of the important information on the SCORE screen can be displayed
on your DISPLAY constantly.

DISPLAY - This is your prompt line, where you may display one or all of
the following statistics; Hitpoints(H), Mana(M), Movement(V), Gold(G), 
and your health percentage.  When fighting an opponent, the opponent's
health percentage will also display.
usage: DISP ALL, DISP NONE, or customize (simply type DISPLAY for options)

AUTOEXIT - This will tell you all obvious exits at the bottom of each room
description.

AUTOLOOT - This will cause you to automatically loot corpses upon their death.

AUTOASSIST - This will cause you to automatically assist any player you are
grouping with, causing you to join in every fihgt without using any commands.

AUTOSPLIT - This will do two things - it will cause you to split all gold
from kills with those in your group, it will also cause you to automatically
retrieve all gold from corpses upon their death, whether yo are grouped or
not.

WHO - This will tell you who is on at the time.

Other basic information:
*You are loaded with a minimal amount of gold and equipment. The equipment
is not the best equipment on the mud, but it is sufficient to get you
through your first level or two.  More eq can be found on the corpses of
your kills, or at the shops found in your hometown. 
SEE ALSO: TAKE BUY GET
*Most of the equipment in Dibrova is level-based, meaning that it cannot be
worn by a player below a certain level, this is determined by the level of
the creature wearing it.
*When gaining levels, it is best to try and wear equipment which raises your
CON and WIS, and in the case of spell casters, your INT.  CON helps you gain
more hitpoints per level, WIS will give more practices, and INT will give
spell casters more mana.
*There is no level stipulation on grouping, players may group with anyone
they desire, and for you newbies, it is not a bad idea to try and get some
help through the first few levels.
*Potions, scrolls and wands can be a big help.  Each casts their own
seperate spell which can be very beneficial to you as a player.
*You cannot go on forever being hungry and thirsty.  After a period of time
you will begin losing hitpoints from starvation or dehydration.  You will
also gain hitpoints faster if you are not hungry or thirsty.

Any other questions, feel free to ask an immortal or a player.

OGRE

Ogre are big, ill-tempered, hairy, ugly creatures with green skin and an
attitude to match.  They are phenomenally strong, but are not usually all
that agile, making their strength more brute than calcutlated and built.

Ogres are best used in the gladiator class.  They are too mean to conform
to the disciplines of knighthood, and the arts of spell-casting completely
eludes them.
#
PALADIN

Paladins are considered the 'white knights' of Dibrova.  They live to serve
the various people of the world, they do good deeds and worship the Gods of
Law and Peace.  Paladins are given the ability to not only fight well, but
cast spells as well.

To see a list of spells and skills available to you, type 'skills' or 'spells'.

SEE ALSO: PRACTICE, SKILLS, SPELLS
#
PKILL "PLAYER KILLING"

Player killing is sanctioned on Dibrova after a player reaches level 100.

A level 100 player may only pkill others who are also level 100 or above.

Pkill can also be done through clans, please see 'help clan' for more details.

Player killing and the 'etiquette' involved can sometimes be a hazy issue
for the more sadistic of the player base, so we will attempt to clear some
of the basic issues now:

- Corpse looting: It is not possible through the code to loot a player's
  corpse once you have killed them.

- 'Cherry Picking': It is not considered even reasonably acceptable to wait
  over a player's corpse in ambush after you have killed them. Let the player
  retrieve their items and gain some health before you attempt to kill them
  again.     

- No Multis

Repeated offenses and abuse of pkill to other players will result in a
level loss of a minimum of 51 levels.

#
SORCERER "MAGIC USER" WIZARD MAGE

This is the class of powerful and violent magic, but the magic user do not
control the nature, and can therefore not bless and such.

You can improve your spells by using the practice command.

See 'spells' for a list of spells available.

#
MALATHAR

Malathar is the educational center in Dibrova, where most of the elite and
wealthy send their young to be trained for the more prestigious arts of
the arcane.

The Duke and Duchess in Malathar are extensions of the law enforcement that
is mainly administered by the Lord in Jareth, the overseer of all things
good in Dibrova.
#
MANA

Mana is used when casting spells.  You must have a certain amount of mana
in order to cast any particular spell.  If you do not have enough mana to
cast the spell you must rest until you gain enough points to cast.

#
MCGINTEY COVE

McGintey Cove is the main seaport and trade center for all of Dibrova.
The city offers a wide variety of shops and vendors, a huge bazaar and
a guild area unsurpassed by any town in the city.

There is an area for gambling, an area for gladiator fights and betting,
and of course, the dock area with a mutitude of pleasures and pains which
may or may not be to your liking.

McGintey is by the far the city in Dibrova which offers the most in terms
variety and size.               
#
MIDGAARD 

Midgaard is not the largest of cities in Dibrova, not by far, but it is a
major cultural and economic center for the world.

A great many amenities are available to aid the newbie, not to mention there
are a large number of neighboring towns and forest villages which trade
frequently with the shopkeepers of Midgaard.

If there were a city that might be considered the Jack of all Trades, it
would definately be Midgaard. 
#
MONK

Monks are the 'mental' class in Dibrova.  They combine mental focus in
creating spells with the ability of using that same mental focus to use
superior fighting skill in combat.  Monks are generally not a strong class
physically, but are very smart fighters, who will always have the upper
hand in close combat. Monks tend to keep to themselves, usually shunning the
city and the folk therein.

Monk's derive additional power from ancients and mystical forces.  These 
powers are conjured by the monks chants.  Chants are used by issuing the 
"Chant" command.

Monks have the ability to excel in barehanded combat provided they wield
no weapon and keep their hands free of other accoutrements (no shield,
gauntlets or hold item) (lights are permitted).  Being free to move
allows them to create devastating offensive attacks.
Offensively, monks traverse
the path of enlightenment through many kick and hand techniques.  In
order of difficulty, these are:
            
Kick Techniques
1. Lotus Kick - A basic front foot kick.
2. Tornado Kick - A wild spinning kick able to strike many times.
3. Crescent Kick - A high striking kick able to blind opponents.
4. Butterfly Kick - A ferocious double-leg kick able to topple foes.
5. Rabid Squirrel Kick - A legendary kick, does it even exist?
   
Hand Techniques
1. Iron Fist - A basic crushing blow.
2. Dragon Claw - A raking strike.
3. Red Buddha Fist - A spiritual flaming palm.
4. Devil's Claw - A wicked strike able to draw the life from opponents.
5. Eye Of The Phoenix - An extremely focused pressure-point strike.
6. Seven Star Earthquake Fist - A brutal flurry able to knock down foes.
7. Heavenly Thunder Palm - A spiritual electrical palm.
8. Quivering Palm - A legendary strike, but does it even exist?
            
All techniques are performed randomly and automatically and new
techniques will begin to surface as you attain higher levels.  Techniques
will not be performed if any of the forbidden arms are worn (weapon,
shield, gauntlets, and hold items).  As the monk is a focused warrior of
spirit and body, their power is often linked to their spiritual and
physical characteristics (dex, str, wis, con).  Also, as monks fight with
emphasis on placement and knowledge of sensitive areas over brute force,
their capacity is enhanced through the ability to accurately strike
(hitroll) instead of raw power (damroll).  Of course, when fighting with
a weapon, monks are affected by damroll and are able to don all arms  
usable by their class.
    
You can improve your skills and chants by using the practice command.

You can see a list of your skills and chants by typing 'skills' or 'chants'.

a newbie helper to re-outfit themselves with the initial load eq that new
players start with.

#
RANGER

Rangers combine the arts of war and the art of healing and woodslore
to make the class an extremely enjoyable one to play.  Rangers aren't
spellcasters in the traditional sense, although many have remarked that
their abilities seem quite magical.  Rangers have an affinity toward
the 'art' of fighting, their skills and abilities in that area tend to
be more graceful than that of the sometimes clumsy warrior.   Their
ability to find food and water, to heal others with pultices and herbs,
and to travel for long periods of time without tiring makes them a
valuable asset to any party.

You can improve your skills by using the practice command.

You can see a list of your skills by typing 'skills'.

Rangers may earn up to THREE attacks per round!

#
RECALL

Recall instantly teleports a player to the last place they entered the
game. Most commonly used for recall is the SCROLL OF RECALL, which is
sold in every magic shop in every hometown.

Recall is also a  command that newbies may use up to level 10 without 
need of a spell or scroll to aid them.

Usage: recall
#
SCAN

Scan allows you to see what players or mobs may be in adjacent rooms from
the one you stand within. If an adjacent room is dark, you will not be
able to see what is in the next room.

Scan is also a good way to find doors which are not shown on AUTOEXITS.
When a message reading 'Something blocks your vision.' shows, it usually
means that there is a door in the direction of that message.

#
SHOPS

Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for his quests,
and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to survive the perils
with his life and sanity intact.  Many shops trade only in a specific type of
merchandise.  Thus, a baker may well refuse to buy your armor, even if it is
of high quality!

To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a shop by
murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The shopkeepers are 
often rugged, capable men; roughened by years of trading and, indeed, surviving
in a world where the only safe prospect is death in the end.

#
SILVERTHORNE

Silverthorne is sister-city to Midgaard, only a short distance through the
forest from gate to gate. Although not as large as Midgaard, Silverthorne
does boast every amenity to the watward traveler that is absolutely required
for travel.

Silverthorne boasts a very elite military force of archers and knights which
are the pride of Dibrova, the first into battle and the last out.

A proud and beautiful city, Silverthorne is perfect for the gallant and the
bold.
#

that they are available at.

Skills which are listed are only for the class which your character is,
listings for skills within other classes can only be had by those classes.

A list of the spells which are offered by your class can be had by using
the command SPELLS.

#
SPELL SPELLS

Spells may only be cast by certian classes; sorcerors, paladins, and
dark knights.  The non-casting classes can use spells, but only through
instruments created by the spell-casters such as potions, wands, and
staves.

When a spell is cast by a player, it uses up a set amount of a player's
mana.  Each spell has its own cost in mana, please refer to each individual
spell's help file for the mana cost.  When a player's supply of mana is
exhausted, he/she must wait for enough time to pass to regain some mana
or find a healer who is willing to help or they may not cast any more spells.

Using this command will show you a list of spells which are available to 
your class and at what level they are offered.

A list of skills may be had in the same fashion by using the command SKILLS.

SPELLPOWER "SPELL POWER"

TRITON

Tritons are sons of Poseidon, creatures of the sea who are at home both in
and out of the sea.  Triton are of the same stature as humans, looking
much the same, except for a small set of gills in their neck a few inches
below their ears and tangled mass of hair which is a result of being
immersed in sea water so much.

Tritons' main advantage over the other classes is that they can BREATHE
underwater wihtout need of any spells or magical objects.  They are
average with most stats, making them a bit like humans, where they will
do well as most any class.
#
VALKYRIE

Legend has it that Valkyries were warriors in the service of the God Odin
who fell in battle, were ressurected and were given the ability fly.
This is just a legend (or is it?) but the fact that Valkyries have a
somewhat mystical aura about them and have wings to give them the power
of flight cannot be denied.

Valkyries do not have any particular affinity for any stats or classes in
general, but are certainly a playable class, as they do not need the help
of any objs or spells to walk on water, plus they use less movement per
round than any other class.
#
WOLFEN

Wolfen are humanoid creatures raised in the wild by creatures of the wild
who train them in the arts of woodslore and fighting.  They are not normally
found in cities, and if so, their stay is not a long one.  They are most
times lone fighters, prefering to fend for themselves.

Wolfen make great Rangers most of all, but can be excellent gladiators if
statted properly.  They can cast spells well enough, but are not a natural
race for casting.

Wolfen have natural infravision.
#
GLADIATOR WARRIOR FIGHTER

Gladiators are known to have more strength than the average player.  This makes
them better at hand-to-hand-combat, as they possess skills of violence and
fighting unequaled by the members of any other class.  However, they lack the
ability to use magic of any sort.

You can improve your skills by using the practice command.

Gladiators can earn up to FIVE attacks per round!

To see a list of skills available to you, type 'skills'.

VENDOR "VENDOR MOBILE"

Vendors Mobiles let players and clans get away from the killing and looting
of normal life and settle down as a nice merchant to seek out their fortune.

Upon buying a Vendor you will be given you choice of locations to place the
vendor the only outlawed locations being:

Rooms with Vendors already placed.
Inns.
Existing game or clan run shops.
PEACEFUL rooms
Rooms that are deemed 'unfit' by the Immortal helping with the Vendor creation.

After you have placed your Vendor you will be given a room that will serve as
a store room for your Vendor Mobile, objects that you place in this room will
be sold by your Vendor at a 3x markup of the objects value. When the item is
sold at the Vendor, the owner will receive %75 of the sell value, the remaining
%25 will go to the Vendor himself for operating costs.

It is up to the owner of the Vendor to keep the Vendor stocked with items! The
Vendor can only sell what is in his storeroom.

In order for an individual to purchase a Vendor they must already own atleast
one house.

In order for a clan to purchase a Vendor they must already own atleast own zone.
A clan hall is counted as a zone.

Vendors are priced thus:

Vendor Level:

Level  50         -    500K Gold
Level 100         -    750K Gold
Level 150         -    1 Million Gold
Level 200         -    2 Million Gold

Vendor Location:

Within City Limits   -     1 Million Gold
Outside City Limits  -     500K Gold

Examples:

A level 50 Vendor placed in Midgaard would cost 1.5 Million in gold.
A level 100 Vendor placed in the Dibrovan Grasslands would cost 1.25 Million.

VIM

Vim is the equivalent of mana for a ranger. Many of the rangers' skills use
the embodiment of nature and the essence of the forest, calling upon those
resources to aid them in their journies.

Vim is not along the same scale as mana; most of the abilities which use vim
use less amounts per use than a spell uses mana, but the philosophy is much
the same.

CircleMUD was developed from DikuMUD (Gamma 0.0) by Jeremy "Ras" Elson at
Johns Hopkins University's Department of Computer Science.  All code unique
to CircleMUD is protected under a copyright by the Trustees of the Johns
Hopkins University.

Many, many people contributed to CircleMUD in one way or another throughout
the course of its development.  Although it's impossible for me to remember
them all, I'd like to extend special thanks to certain people:

  -- Jeff Fink and George Greer, for submitting a veritable mountain of
     excellent code.
  -- Chris Epler and Chris Herringshaw for extensive beta-testing and bug
     reporting.
  -- Furry (Alex Fletcher), for single-handedly managing Circle's world files.
  -- Fred Merkel, Ryan Watkins, Jay Levino, and Sharon Goza, for other
     code and area submissions.
  -- Jean-Jack Riethoven for porting the code to the Amiga, David Carver
     for porting it to OS/2, and Jack Patton and Steffen Haeuser for the
     Amiga port.
  -- Bill Bogstad and Tim Stearns for allowing Circle to exist at JHU.
  -- The DikuMUD folk, and the good old WhatMUD implementors Dave & Justin,
     for starting the ball rolling.
  -- Bryan Jolson, Steven Lacher, Cat Stanton, and Naved Surve, for being 
     there in the very early days of Circle's development.
  -- Sharon, Ben, Erica, Aly, and Josh, for keeping me sane.
  -- Jules (hamotek sheli) for being the greatest.

...plus everyone else in the Circle community who has submitted material!
Thanks everyone!
