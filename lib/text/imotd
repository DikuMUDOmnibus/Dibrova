These friars were behind on their belfry payments, so
they opened up a small florist shop to raise funds.
Since everyone liked to buy flowers from the men of God,
a rival florist across town thought the competition was
unfair.  He asked the good fathers to close down, but they
would not. He went back and begged the friars to close.
They ignored him. So, the rival florist hired Hugh MacTaggart,
the roughest and most vicious thug in town to "persuade"
them to close.

Hugh beat up the friars and trashed their
store, saying he'd be back if they didn't close up shop.
Terrified, they did so, thereby proving that: Hugh, and Hugh
alone, can prevent florist friars.

(This would make a cool mini-quest zone) ;)
