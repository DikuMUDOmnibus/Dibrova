/cWOur policies are few - nothing that might seem out of the ordinary to any
player who has played a MUD before. To any new MUDders, these are the 
common staple:

- No bots, no autofighting. If you aren't here to play, enjoy the game and
  add to the overall atmosphere, please come back at another time when
  you are able to do so.

- We do not allow multiplay on Dibrova. Player ips are restricted in the
  code for multiple logins. 

- No harassing of other players. If another player chooses not to respond
  to a GOS or TELL, then they probably have good reason. Players who wish
  to remain lone wolves will be left alone.

- Immortals will occasionally give a healing FLUX that will completely
  restore every player in the game. Odds are if you ask for one, though,
  imms will develop selective hearing.

- Swearing and cursing will not be tolerated. We understand frustration
  at times and will occassionally turn the other way, but if cursing or
  harassing other players becomes a problem, you will be muted.

- If you get stuck in a room or area which has no exit and you forgot
  to buy a recall before you left town, too bad. Don't ask an imm to
  help you and remember to buy a recall next time.

- Multi's are not permitted in the arena. Single players only.
