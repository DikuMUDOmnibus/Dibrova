a small rock.~
An oak staff has been left here, with a tiny rock at its head.~
This small but sturdy staff seems to have gone through
no small amount of battles.  With numerous chunks
of wood lost here and there, it pretty much looks
as worthless as it feels in your hands.

Really no use for you now is it?
