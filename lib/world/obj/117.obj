a tall statue~
A tall statue of a man has been built here.~
   The crumbling statue's face is too weather worn to make out many
details.  The man is looking down at you as if to pass judgment or to
show disapproval with your actions.  Upon closer inspection you see
that the statue isn't that old, it was just poorly made and hasn't
stood the test of time well.
