No favoring mortals.  (loading eq for them, teleporting them, resetting
mobs or zones...)

Use FLUX sparingly and NEVER because a player asks you for one.

Do NOT reimburse players for lost experience or equipment.  If a player
needs a reimb, find an IMP and it will be taken care of.  If there are
no IMPs on, inform the player that they will be reimb'd accordingly 
once an IMP is on.

All players, including immortals are deleted after 30 days of inactivity.

Immortal rooms and objs MUST be mudmailed to kaan.  These rooms MAY NOT
be connected to the general areas on the mud.  All immortal rooms must
be part of the God Simplex. (Zone 12)

A note has been left here, dropped carelessly in a corner.~
Any new player who wishes to build for Dibrova must meet these requirements
and follow this general criteria:

- Must have at least two years experience building with muds,
  preferably with an OLC like Oasis.

- Must contact Kaan or Greyfeather to set up an interview and build test
  rooms, mobs, and objs in test zone on builder port.

- Builders are required to produce one zone per month (minimum of
  50 rooms) 
  *exceptions can be made to this rule - see Kaan or Rodger for details.

Many of you are aware that we lost our coder semi-recently.

I have made several attempts to locate another such individual with little
to no success.

I have made the decision to move my files and myself as an imm over to a
different game. Many of you are familiar with Cities of Glory, so many of
you know that I was a player there for a couple of years before I started
Dibrova. I know that the immortals on that port have gotten a bad
reputation over time, through actions of their own. Most of the immortals
that were there are still there, however in a limited capacity. I hope
that through my own involvement and the involvement of Storm there (he
is known as Zaylon over there) any players who visit CoG from Dibrova
will be able to make it their new home.

I apologize for being unable to keep Dibrova alive - it truly breaks
my heart. I had nothing but good times here. I have saved every file
associated with Dibrova in hopes that one day we might rise from the
ashes again.

Cities of Glory's gaming address is bucket.ualr.edu  port 4000

Kaan is my mortal there and Lord is my imm (don't get confused ;-)

I will try and help those of you new to CoG with my mortal to get you
through the first 15 or 20 levels, as Kaan is a relatively decent
character over there.

I hope to see you all over there and thank you for playing Dibrova
for the last couple years. Its been a very good time.

Kaan
