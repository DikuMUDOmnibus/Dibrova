The Labyrinth of the Minotaur

In days of yore, when minotaurs and their ilk roamed free in the land 
killing, raping, and pillaging wantonly, the land hereabouts was infested 
with the foulest, cruelest minions of evil that ever walked Dibrova.

In the year of the Onyx Moon, after the crusades had ended, an Ionian Knight, 
who would one day become the first Lord of Jareth, led his brother and a 
score of men to battle against the evil hordes.  Although the Lord's brother 
and many other brave men fell, the battle was won and here the Lord made 
new home and haven naming it for his dead brother the knight Jareth.

Of all the creatures the men fought, only one creature, one mighty being 
could they not vanquish, this being the Minotaur.  This Minotaur, so protected 
by it's evil magic could only be captured, not killed, and so being this the case, 
the Lord made it so that the Minotaur would spend the rest of it's days 
imprisoned in this Labyrinth forever, never again to see the light of day.

As years passed, the Labyrinth became a well used tool of justice for the many 
Lords who followed after the first.  For every criminal who's crimes merited 
more than a simple death penalty, those who's crimes were so despicable as 
to have wished upon them the cruelest of fates, they were thrown into the 
Labyrinth with the Minotaur, there to make whatever life possible in that 
dismal Hell.

It is said now that the Minotaur has gathered closest to it the mightiest of 
those imprisoned in it's home, surrounding itself with might, allowing the 
lesser creatures to live, but on their own, to scratch out a life in the Outer 
Reaches of the Labyrinth.

A bounty, placed by the first Lord and still holding to this very day, is on the
Minotaur's head.  Any who bring the head of this horned demon before 
whatever Lord reigns will receive their bounty.

Good Luck, and may the Gods be with you, and remember, once entered, the 
Labyrinth may not be exited without the power of recall.
