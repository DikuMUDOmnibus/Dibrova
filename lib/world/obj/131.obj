teeth bohemoth~
These large, white teeth are strong and sharp.  Though marring their 
appearance are several gaping holes.  Perhaps with the right amount of
effort.  Those holes could be filled in, making the entire set of teeth 
much stronger and a more effective weapon.

Blade Fire~
The god of shadows forged this extraordinary blade long prior to the
existence of man; its hilt shines golden whilst the blade is pure
flame.  No one has ever managed to put the blaze out.  It even works
underwater.  A symbol is engraved upon the hilt, but you have no idea
as to what it is supposed to represent.
