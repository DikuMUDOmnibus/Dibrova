-/cw
Long ago, an Elven Wizard rose to might and ruled the Elven Tree City...
She noticed the dire need to create a SAFE path through the Grasslands
which lie west of the city.
Drawing upon the magic of elves and the power of the setting /cysun/cw...
a /cWPEACEFUL/cw path was created, which lies /crSTRAIGHT WEST/cw from
the mighty gates of the City to the roads of Jareth/Midgaard.
Wander off the path at your own risk!
