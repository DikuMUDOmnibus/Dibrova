belt vine swamp~
/cwa belt made of /cGswamp vine/c0~
/cwA belt made of /cGswamp vine/cw has been abandoned here./c0~
It is large enough to loop around a human waist twice.  The thorns
that protrude from it somehow do not prick you while wearing it.

ollcas~
His skin looks to be still wet and slimy, as bullywogs tend to be in
life.  Upon touching his skin, you find that there is some sort of
cream or ointment that has been applied.  Possibly it is what keeps
his corpse from decay.

It reads:

My wonderful husband.

The one who looked far past my outer shell into the depths of my heart.
The one for whom I still carry on.

Your memory will never die within me, my love.
