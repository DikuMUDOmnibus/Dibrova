Welcome adventurers!

You have traveled long and hard to arrive at this place alive.
Now, be warned that the Castle of the Abyss should not be attempted
by those level 100 or less.  To the north lies a fantastic realm.
To go there, you must be able to defeat my minions of fire, these
flaming efreets.  If you defeat them and obtain the key, then I
bid thee welcome!

Forever yours,
Apocalypse
