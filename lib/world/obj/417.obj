The Eldar have not always been the race of strong magics and arcane
natures are they are today.

There was a time in the not so long distant past that the Eldar were
much like any other race, living in the cities and striving to make
their mark upon the world in whatever way they could.

Then came the time of the Rendering, a dark time full of peril for 
not just the Eldar race, but for all races.

None, however, lost so much as the Eldars in that terrible blast
from the Gods.

The great and powerful god of darkness, Rendor, felt that the Eldar 
race was a hindrance to the world. He felt that the Eldar were 
inferior to all others, being slight of stature and not with any 
particular affinity for any useful skills.

Rendor, in one of his fits of personal rage, ordered his dark goblin 
troops to massacre any and all Eldar that they came across.

And massacre they did, all across the lands from sea to sea until
there were but a handful left.

This is how the Eldar came to be a race living in underground
caverns, hidden from the view of the legions of Rendor's dark army.

Now in the midst of all this chaos, there came one god who saw
the plight of the Eldar and took pity - the god Vedic.

Vedic appeared to the Eldar, who were huddled in fear of most any
creature other than one of their own, and Vedic said to them:

"Fear not, My people, for I come to you with a protection. One 
which will keep you from danger for all the days that you live so
long as you in turn protect that which protects you."

And with those words, the god Vedic gave unto the Eldar race the
Seven Wards of the Arcane, the power of which imbued the Eldar
race with an affinity for magic and concealment from Rendor 
forever.
It is said that if the Seven Wards ever were to be taken from 
their Chambers and brought together by one being, that being 
would suffer a fate worse than death at the hands of the god Vedic.
Not only would that being suffer, but the fate of the entire 
Eldar nation would be at stake.

And so the Seven Keepers of the Seven Wards watch over their
charge, keeping the Wards safe for all time so that the Eldar 
might continue forever as a dominant force in the world.
