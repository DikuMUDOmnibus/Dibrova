and these goods and services change daily.  Be sure to
make the bazaar an all day stop if you have the time!

Another of the Cove's attractions is the Gladiator Pit
located in the Guild Area, which is just west of the main
business district.  At the Gladiator Pit one can place wagers
on on-going fights, or participate themsleves in a battle
to the death!  What more could one ask for in a day's
adventures?
Also, be sure to visit the Guild Area for one-of-a-kind items
only found in this town, items made specifically for each class
from warrior to thief to mage to cleric!

If you are looking for more high class entertainment, the Wharf,
McGintey's high class district, offers casinos galore and many fine

night of gambling and feasting!


And last, but not least, do not forget that McGinety Cove is the main
seaport for Dibrova, where can book passage on any number of commercial
travel ships which sail all over Dibrova.  Just head to the Docks and
look for the Boat Station, tickets can be purchased every day all day
long.

May your stay in McGintey be not only long and restful, but also as
memorable as any stay in any town ever!  Have a great time!
