letter~
Inhabitants of Dibrova,
My keep is under attack by an army of an unknown kingdom. Please send aid.
They have already breached our southern defenses and I don't know how much
longer we can hold out against their superior numbers. If you agree to help
us my messenger will safely guide you through our northern defensive wall.
I only hope you get this in time.

Baron Oddjob
