   Rome was written by Onivel of JediMUD in the spring of 1992.  It was
originally debugged and tested on Renaissance DikuMUD and then ported to
CircleMUD and finally JediMUD.  I would like to sincerely thank the following
people who gave invaluable help in the design and construction of this area:

 Rasmussen of CircleMUD  -- for idea to write Rome in the first place and for
			    advice with coding Roman god routines.

 Destiny of Apocalypse   -- for encouragement, proofreading, help in refining
                            the area concept and allowing me to put my first 
			    area on her MUD.

 Miranda, Romulus, Ikee, and all the others who assisted with balance, bugs
 and typo eradication, or just had a good time here.

 Thanks.
   -Onivel
