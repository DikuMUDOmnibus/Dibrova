Newbie Asylum~
The Newbie Asylum is an old stone building, standing here with an
atmosphere of gloom and depression.  It has housed the insane
inhabitants of Dibrova for centuries.  Despite the fact that times
have changed, the tactics and treatment of the hospitalized are still
primitive and often cruel.

Inside The Asylum~
You are in the entrance to the Asylum.  The walls, although possibly
at one time long ago could have been white and clean, are now grimy
and caked with dirt and Newbie vomit.  The smell here is horrific, and
the very thought that this is just the ENTRANCE makes your stomach
curdle, knowing full well that it must get worse in deeper.  To the
east is Newbie Sign-In and west is the lobby.  There is a door to the
north.

A Lobby~
This is the lobby and waiting room here at the Newbie Asylum.  A
nurse's office lies off to the west, the main entrance east.  Dirty
but comfortable looking chairs are scattered throughout the room,
perhaps you'd like to rest a spell?

Nurse's Office~
This room reeks of ammonia and feces...  Nice combination there.  
Like every other room in this place, the walls are grubby and miskept,
the floors look like they haven't been swept, let alone mopped, in
months, possibly longer!  Maybe you could get a check-up...?

Sign-In~
This is where visitors to the Asylum are to sign in for the duration
of their stay.  The badges sitting here designate one as a visitor and
not a resident, so it may be a good idea to get one (just in case they
make a mistake).

This is the first floor hallway of the asylum.  Flickering torches
light the way through this dismal place.  The walls are whitewashed
and moldy.  Vile odors penetrate the air and hangs about like a
sickness.  The hallway continues east and west.  A doorway leading out
of the building can be seen to the south.

This main room seems to go on and on and on, giving the inmates plenty
of space to roam.  It's probably best just to let them keep doing just
that - you wouldn't want to mess with their head, or anything.

This large room houses all of the space that these loony Newbies need
to roam around hitting themselves and talking to their imaginary
friends.  The room opens up to the west and from here you can see
quite a number of crazy newbies.  Maybe you should kill them...  
There is a small hallway leading off this main room to the east.

Cell~
The walls are made up of thick white padding, designed to prevent the
patient from harm.  The padding itself is tattered and worn, having
seen numerous years of abuse from patients hurling themselves against
the walls in fits of anger, rage, and frustration.  Besides the
patient, there are no objects in the room, since everything is brought
in by attendants and taken out immediately for fear of leaving an
object that could be used as a weapon.  A magical force across the
doorway prevents the patient from escaping the room.

Stairs~
This is the landing at the top of the stairs.  The air is hot and
filled with foul odorous scents which assult your senses.  The
Research and Development Lab is to the west, while down takes you back
to the main hallway.

Research and Development Area~
A plain room, devoid of furniture and objects (for fear of certain
folks getting hurt).  Torn and tattered padding line the walls,
showing that many patients have been here for the sake of science.  
The floor is stained a nasty, yellowish color, making one wish they
didnt have to tread here.  A clear force shield lies west, while the
landing is east.

Research and Development Area~
This is the Researcher's booth, where one can stay and observe the
patients in relative safety.  A shelf, filled with all kinds of
scientific and psychological books, lies on the west wall.  To the
north, east, and south is a clear force shield which keeps one safe in
here and prevents the entry of unauthorized persons.  A table sits in
the middle of the room, surrounded by tall stools used for
observation.

The Wasteland.~
A sick looking grey-white dirt covers the landscape in all directions.
As you scan the landscape further, you notice small clumps of brown
grass growing sporadicly.  The thing you notice most though, is the
slight quaking accompanied by a loud booming in the distance.  A large
sign /cRSCREAMS/c0 for your attention.

Within the Giant's Stomach.~
You stand knee deep in a thick green slurry.  Pieces, chunks, and
sometimes even a whole animal floats past you.  Looking up you notice
the entrance to the esophaguas and a possible way out of here, if only
you could climb up there.  There is more of the giant's stomach to the
east.

The Stomach.~
The knee deep green slurry that makes up the contents of the giant's
stomach swirls about you forming a whirlpool that drains into the
small intestine.  As a deer struggles to keep from being sucked
downwards you figure you might as well follow the crowd..

The Small Intestine.~
Out of the pot and into the frying pan.  You are barely able to stand
inside of the small intestine.  It twists and turns all around making
it easy to get lost.  The small intestine continues east.

The Small Intestine.~
The green slurry seems to be getting thicker.  The twisty, curvy
passage of the small intestine leads farther downward.  Your friend
the, the unlucky deer, is heading that way.  Why not you?

The small intestine pulsates around you, pushing you farther down the

almost serene fashion.
