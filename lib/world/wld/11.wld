a dead end.  Closer examination reveals an archway to the south.  But
so many cobwebs cover the archway that they've formed a completely
opaque door.  The corridor continues back to the west.

The air is very stale in here.  Cobwebs cover the walls and ceiling,
however the middle of the room is relatively clear of them.  In each
corner of this chamber, an ancient sarcophagus lies against the wall.
There is a low grinding noise as they all start to open.  The only

sarcophagus lies on the floor in the center of the room, and leaning
over it, sobbing deeply, rests a banshee.  She seems to be too

dust.  Two large rubies are placed within its eye sockets and its
teeth glint of sparkling diamonds.  You do not like the way it looks
back at you and seems to grin.  You feel a presence of great evil in
