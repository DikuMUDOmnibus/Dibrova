The Entrance to the South Tower~
This room used to house the entrance to the South Tower.  However, for
some reason, the south tower has vanished.  Before you is a view from
the south tower, inverted.  The sky is below while the ground is
above.  Above you can see the door to the Treasury, but how to get
there is another question.

Entrance to the Treasury~
You are standing before a door to the treasure.  A small inverted arch
supports you, barely, and while your stomache turns flips at your view
of the world upside down, your footing seems solid.  Perhaps you had
better get out of this place, quickly, before you lose your balance.

lie about, sodden with dampness, and bins of metal equipment have
rusted into complete dust.  A silver scabbard sits against the south
wall on a plaque.  The fabled Curtana, the sword of compulsion, used
to be kept here.  It seems to have been stolen.

vegetation, and leaves you with a relatively clear view of the sky.  
Squirrels chatter loudly in the trees and birds swoop down to get a
quick glance at you.

It is easy to see where the Kingdom gets it name, since this entire
land is one massive forest.  The weather here is decent, not being too
hot nor too cold and the traveling is easy.

You are surrounded lightly by trees of all types.  You recognized
mostly firs and pines, but catch view of other trees, like rowans,
acorns, and even a few spruce trees.  The wind is cool and refreshing,
making you almost want to set up camp here for the rest of the day.

The Forest Land~
You are in the forest that comprises most of the Forest Kingdom.  The
underbrush of dried leaves and needles crunch under your foot, sending
skitterish animals fleeing at the sounds.  Other animals are not as
easy scared, however, and a bluejay screeches at you from above.

The Forest Land~
You are in the forest that comprises most of the Forest Kingdom.  The
underbrush of dried leaves and needles crunch under your foot, sending
skitterish animals fleeing at the sounds.  Other animals are not as
easy scared, however, and a bluejay screeches at you from above.

The Forest Land~
You are exploring the Forest Kingdom which is spread all about you.  
It is easy to see where the Kingdom gets it name, since this entire
land is one massive forest.  The weather here is decent, not being too
hot nor too cold and the traveling is easy.

The Forest Land~
You are walking along a forest land filled with trees of all kinds.  
The forest itself is light, not being densely populated with
vegetation, and leaves you with a relatively clear view of the sky.  
Squirrels chatter loudly in the trees and birds swoop down to get a
quick glance at you.

The Forest Land~
You are surrounded lightly by trees of all types.  You recognized
mostly firs and pines, but catch view of other trees, like rowans,
acorns, and even a few spruce trees.  The wind is cool and refreshing,
making you almost want to set up camp here for the rest of the day.
