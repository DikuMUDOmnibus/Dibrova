Side Alley~
This alley is so narrow, wedged between the brick walls of two
buildings, that it shuts out most of the light that might filter
through - even at high noon.  It runs north into a darkened area of
town, apparently a larger section of town at that - a breeze can be
felt blowing through from that direction, indicating open space.  To
the south is the open area of Society Road, cheerful and relatively
safe.

Side Alley~
Just north of here is the end of an open road, one that does look to
be well tended, but certainly well used.  There are no obvious exits
into the buildings on either side of this alley, just tall, blank,
unyielding brick walls that wedge you in - making you fair game for
any territorial gangs that might be in the area.

Broken Ending~
This might once have been a very affluent section of town, a court
where some of riches of the town made their residence.  The fact that
the Thieven Guild lies just down the street, housing some of the most
affluent thieves known to the world, makes it so that no sane townsman
would consider walking these streets - even in broad daylight - let
alone live in this area.  On the north and east sides of the street
are the crumbling ruins of old homes that were once fine, prominent
homes.  They have long since dilapidated into festering eyesores,
places that only the locals of this area - almost all thieves by trade
- would think about going into.  A dark, narrow alley lies to the
south.  To the west, this cracked and broken road heads into the wary
darkness of the Thieven Guild area.

Broken Road~
Kicking aside bits of broken stone and the junk that is littered all
over, you make your way down this awful street, the smell of the place
rancid, the look of it even worse.  On the north and south sides of
the road are buildings that might once have been fine homes, but are
now used as businesses.  A dagger lies scrawled above the door on the
north side, a dirty coat of arms above the door of the building on the
south side.

Darkened Roadway~
Bits and pieces of rubble lie in chunks all about you along this
dilapidated street, most of the original cobbles missing.  On the
north side of the road is the eastern-most end of the Thieven
Guildhall, a huge mansion that was once owned by a very prominent
businessman from Silverthorne who decided - after the guilds came to
town - that his financial investment in the property wasn't worth what
he thought it was.  On the south side is small shack, looking for all
the world very out of place.

Before the Entryway to the Thieven Guild~
It is said that under no circumstances can anyone who is not a member
of the thieven taint enter into the guild.  Rumor has it that at one
time, many years back, a fair-sized group of men from the mercenary's
guild decided to make a raid on the Theiven Guildhall, just for fun.
They left the merc's guild that night, never to return.  No one has
ever pursued the notion of bringing the Thieven Guild up on charges.
On the south side of the road is a very loud and very dingy-looking
tavern.  Enter if you feel you can handle it.

Darkened Roadway~
The road runs east and west, its crumbling stone and cobbles flaking
away even as you tread upon them.  On the north side of the road is
western-most end of the Thieven Guildhall - the most feared and
talked-about place in the city.  It is said that even though there are
three guilds in the city that run most of the government, it is the
Thieven Guildhall that calls most of the shots.  Even the mercenary
guild bows its head to the Thieven Guildhall - though never in public.
To the south is a crumbling stone building with a crooked sign next to
the front door proclaiming it a clothing shop.

The road makes a feeble turn, heading east into the darkened section
of town owned by the Thieve's Guild.  To the south is the way back
toward the open air of Society Road and relative safety.  A crumbling
ruin of a home lies to the north, its empty windows like dark gaping
eyes staring straight at you.

probably - aside from the Thieven Guildhall - the nicest looking
building in the area.

only at this store, and never encouraged to spend money.  There is
always at least one shopkeep on hand - an employee of the Guild - who
watches for theft, and usually catches most perpetrators.

or broken, huge holes torn into them.  A crooked, rickety set of steps
lie on the north side of the room, heading into a dark upper level.

The General Store~
This tiny, barely-standing shack was built over top of the site of an
old mansion.  Back in the years when the town was just becoming
over-run with the 'bad element' that pervades most of the city now, an
old man and woman owned this property and a fine home which was built
atop this property.  When the Thieven Guild decided that they wished
to own this section of town, they politely asked the man and his wife
to leave.  Just as politely, the man and his wife refused.  They
called it an accident, but the fire that consumed the home and the
lives of the man and his wife occured only days after their refusal.
Now this shack stands in place of the fine home, selling all manner of
worthless necessities.

Rapas' Back-Stickers~
Rapas.  The name of one of the most celebrated thieves to ever walk
the world of Dibrova and still come out without a dagger in his back.
Rapas was one of the first pupils to study under tutelage of the
Thieve's Guild here in Dun Pith, and one of the reasons that even
though holds a less than esteemed reputation, the guild still attracts
hundreds of new students every year.  Rapas left the guild after his
Closing Ceremonies, making his way in the world as a common vagabond,
waylaying travelers and picking pockets in all the major towns.  He
would have ended up rotting in a jail somewhere - like most of his
kind do - if it wasn't for the fact that he was so damned good at what
he did.  He made a fortune in petty theft, and unlike most thieves, he
saved it all - hoarded into a secret lair.  His name soon became
public with most of the city law enforcement agencies and his face was
plastered in every guard station.

their guildsmanship, it would certainly be the endless hours of
lecturing on the morales and standards within the society of thieves
that made their decision for them.

The walls of this room are appointed in the richest of tapestries, the
floors made from a creamy, high gloss marble.  A small podium lies at
the north end of the room, pughs line the east and west sides of the
room, a narrow walkway up the middle.  It would almost seem as a
church - indeed, for many of the students this may just be their
church.

This room is what anyone would expect the Master's inner sanctum to
look like; stately, somber - a thick mahoganey desk sitting square in
the center of the room.  It also gives the feel of a very unused room.

The Master's Private Quarters~
This enormous room is where the Master spends his days, keeping far
from the daily tasks of running the guild in person.  Too many
affluent members of Dun Pith society and beyond would pay handsomely
for the Master's head on a stick, so he keeps his head buried well
beneath the guild, attached to his own body and well-guarded.

Enormous Warehouse~
So this is the where the Raleighs keep their headquarters.  The
Raleighs are a group of renegade outcasts from the Thieven Guildhall -
they are those people who had talent but decided to waste it on petty
acts of spite and evil.  The Raleighs live by cunning and sheer
meanness - preying on the weak of Dun Pith and hiding from the
assassins of the Guilds.

The road south seems all hard angles and sharp edges, everything gets
a very rustic, strong look to it.  There are many of the saem types of
buildings alongside the street as the ones to the north, however these
seem almost without color, or rather without need for color.  An inn
lies to the southeast, a very plain affair with no decor on the
outside whatsoever.

Dun Pith's main, open streets are left behind upon entering onto this

Everything within this section of the city takes on a more pale cast,
as if the colors of the world have been sucked from the walls of
everything around you and displaced with a more grey, somber hue.  A
small stone building lies to the north.
