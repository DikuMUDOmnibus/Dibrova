Clear Skies on the High Sea~
The waters are calm in this beautiful haven on the sea.  The sky is
very bright and clear.  The ocean is a brilliant blue.  The breeze is
warm and with the exception of there being nothing besides water to
look at it has all the makings of a wonderful spot.

Stormy Waters~
The water flings you about as rolling black thunderheads pass

lurches.  It is hard to see far as the tall waves rise and fall, but
from the glimpses you can get you are not within sight of any land.

Clear Skies on the High Sea~
The waters are calm in this beautiful haven on the sea.  The sky is
very bright and clear.  The ocean is a brilliant blue.  The breeze is
warm and with the exception of there being nothing besides water to
look at it has all the makings of a wonderful spot.

Swelling Waves~
This great body of water surges about itself and the waves easily are
reaching twenty feet.  Atop the large waves, white caps curl up as the
fall back towards their watery bed.  All around are waves, waves and
waves.

Hazy Waters~
The haze from the Sea waters hangs heavy in the air.  For a short
distance in every direction you can see the huge waves rolling along
at their own steady pace.  Beyond that short distance a wall of fog
shrouds everything.
