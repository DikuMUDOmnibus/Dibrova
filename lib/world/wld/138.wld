Riverhaven, River Road East~
The town wall curves down to the river and extends out into it with
the heavily-fortified Eastern Tower rising above to keep watch and to
control the river traffic.  A small path passes beneath the tower's
shadow and through a narrow gate, wandering along the barren riverbank
and out of town.  A few boats are pulled up along the shore or bob
gently in the current, tied to the many poles used to control river
traffic.

The store-yards of Natron, the local Salt-seller, rise along the north
side of the road.  Huge piles of sea salt, brought up the weary miles
by barge, lie protected under canvas covers to keep off the rain.  
The riverbank has been despoiled by the briny run-off and little
survives there.  Even the pier is eaten away by the salt.  The wood
looks ready to crumble at a touch.

Riverhaven Exterior, Southeast Gate~
The lanes outside the eastern gate of Riverhaven are crowded with the
bustle of street peddlers and merchant wagons coming and going in a
great rush to sell their wares.  Beggars line the paved road, aware
that the more influential and wealthy folks use this gate.  They
hover, hands extended, hoping that a moment of kindness and charity
might befall them.  A stone bridge that once provided passage across
the river is now little more than a crumbling stone pier used by some
local fishermen.

Set smack amidst the smokehouses and drying racks of the fishing
industry is the Saltfisher Inn, run by a local family, it is the one
bright spot in this drear commercial area.  The center of social life
for the workingfolk of the area, the tavern makes a noble effort to
have good food and drink on call at all hours.

valiant civic efforts to keep the place clean, the stench is

small fish-processing plants.  Racks of salted fillets lie in neat
rows, waiting their turn in the smokehouses.  The area is a magnet for
half the cats in the Province it seems, and you can barely move
without treading on a tail or tripping over some speeding tabby making
off with a mullet as prize.

company.  They keep a cool eye on loiterers and those who seem to have
no noticeable business.

and browse.  Several shopgirls stand together outside one store
decorated with ribbons and bows, apparently on their break.  They
chatter amongst themselves and pass judgement on the fitness of
various males passing by with whistles of approbation or giggles of
amusement at some pot-bellied merchant wearing something that would be
fashionable on anyone but him.

A small cluster of shops forms a wider spot on the river road.  
Displacing the drab warehouses, the brightly-painted stores beckon the
passerby to turn aside from mundane cares and enjoy life.  A line of
children stand, noses pressed against the mullioned windows, outside
what can only be a bakery, judging by the heavy scent of cinnamon and
other sweet spices that floats on the air.  You feel rather tempted to
join the eager row of hungry faces and see what treats reside within.

air and finally wins out.  A half-timbered tavern on the north side of
the road seems to be the source of the pleasant aromas.  A group of
people are gathered on benches beneath the overhanging second story,
enjoying the spectacle of the busy street while quaffing enormous mugs
of the local brew and downing large portions of edibles.

A few houses are scattered about, looking a bit shabby and mildly
unkempt.  The damp river smell mingles with the odor of fish in a
slightly noisome mix.  The one outstanding feature here is the store
front of Ioun's pawnshop.  Resembling the aftermath of an explosion in
a dry goods warehouse, you see everything from the newest in wares, to
items only your grandfather would use.  You also see the entrance to
Noel's Arms.

of the Cleric Guild to the Northwest.  The soothing smell of healing
herbs washes away the odors of the town, leaving your mind feeling
free and at ease with itself.  The dirt and squalor of this back-road
vanish into well-kept stone pavers and neatly trimmed hedges along
both sides.

sick, the suffering, and those who heal them.  The air is fresh and
clean-smelling, and the twin houses of healing gleam from frequent
scrubbing of the stonework.

shovels to ladle mounds of the heavy white crystals into large burlap
sacks that are then hauled away by still more sweating laborers.  A
surly foreman glares at you as if waiting to see if you plan to work
or gawk.

Riverhaven, Halfling Quarter~
Vibrant, though minute, garden plots run alongside the tiny round
homes here.  Even in this bustling town the will, and the constant
hunger, of the gardening Halfling cannot be suppressed.  You also see
an extremely ratty looking Halfling home.

Neat row houses nestle together along both sides of the road.  
White-washed and simple, they each have a yard, many strewn with the
toys and other play-things of the children who prowl these streets by
day.  The momentary glow of a pipe catches your eye, causing you to
notice a lone individual sitting in the shadow of a porch, enjoying
the silence of the evening.

among the dancing shadows like tiny ghosts.

Low walls allow a glimpse into the yards of small businesses and
workshops.  The heavy odor of heated metal still lingers in the dewy
air, drifting from a small shop before you.  However, the absence of
hearing an anvil being pounded assures you the workmen are at home
with their families for the night.  The lane is now devoid of activity
as silence befalls the area.  You also see a warehouse entrance with
some thief graffity written on the side of it.

Tower.  A commercial salt vendor dominates the area, white mounds of
glittering crystals piled high like a miniature mountain range.

Several fish-drying sheds assault your nose with the intensity of
their efforts.  One, worse even than the others, appears to specialize
in some form of pickled fish mixed with some pungent herb or spice
that settles into your nose as if it intended to dwell there.  You
wonder how the guards in the Eastern Tower, set in the river at the
end of the town wall to the south, survive it.  It does seem to have
the minor virtue of driving off the blood flies that infest the
river's edge.

The unmistakable smell of salt mingled with drying fish warns you of
the proximity of the main product of the town.  To the south, the
smell increases as you approach the river.  A few rooming houses and
seedy cottages straggle along the road, their paint long worn off,
exposing the bare wood to the ruinous effects of the salt-laden wind.

A gang of sweating and cursing Dwarves is working on repairs to the
town wall.  Several timbers, even though formed of solid iron-wood,
have been infested with dry rot and are being replaced.  Several
Giants wait to set another heavy beam upright in the stone socket
being prepared for it.  Many of the laborers appear to have come from
the nearby jail, to judge by their leg-irons and bored expressions.

Something has snarled traffic as carts and pedestrians jumble together
in a confusing tangle.  A harried watchman tries to keep everything
moving, but the clog seems an inseparable part of the roadway.  
Several street urchins take the opportunity to lift some fruit from a
passing cart, while the driver argues the right of way with a pair of
liveried servants carrying a curtained sedan chair on poles.

Nothing in your lifetime has prepared you for the clutter you

span the gambit from antique to brand new.  Dust is so thick on some
of the older items that it is difficult to make out any color.  You
kick yourself a path to the counter and are startled by Ioun, the shop
owner, who was hidden by a stack of items on the counter.

Peering through the door, you can see apprentice swordsmiths engaged
in a variety of tasks.  Some clean and polish weapons, another sits
before a spinning stone wheel, carefully grinding a fine edge onto a
rapier blade.

small and simple.  On one wall is one small display case with only
three items.  The lady of the shop bustles up to you in a rustle of
crisp silks and a whiff of something exotic and smiles delicately.

Base of a Watch Tower~
You are at the base of a guard tower.  Above you can hear different
voices snickering as they ponder if they could, infact, hit you with a
lougie from way up there.  You see a narrow ladder leading up to the
tower.

Zanthron's Artificer Shop, Salesroom~
You flinch as you feel slight shocks of static running up your arm
while standing in Zanthron's shop.  A purple and black tapestry hangs
in the back of the shop while glass display cases of miniature animals
sit on shelves arranged haphazardly on another wall.  Zanthron herself
sits on a stool behind the counter scowling at a runestone and
muttering arcane phrases as if looking for an opening in the stone.

Magic Shop~
A small and secluded shop the beads hit your face as you pass through
the entrance.  You are bombarded by the scent of incense and oils .
Before you is Ishamael the Dwarven Mage selling you potions from afar.
He is crouched behind a small table on the floor meditating.
