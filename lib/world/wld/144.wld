Down some old stone Stairs~
The hall ends here and extends to the south.  There is only one other
way to leave this room and that is to go down the stairs.  Vines grow
around the old stone steps, making the descent dangerous.  A few dim
scones light the way, just enough to see a few steps ahead.

Dungeon Keep~
It is cramped and dark here, completely silent as well.  Barely any

give this place an evil look.  Small windows in each cell allow one to
look inside each cell.
