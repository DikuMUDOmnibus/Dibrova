Steps Leading Down to the Sea~
You are on a long flight of steps cut into a cliff face.  Just above
you, the top of the steps looms, while below you, the steps continue
for what seems an eternity.

Down the Cliff-Face~
The steps continue down toward the sea, or up to the crest of the
cliff, depending on the way you're heading.  It looks as if there may
be some sort of cave down from here.

On the Cliff Face~
The stairs continue, however you are much closer to the bottom than
the top now.  There appears to be an opening in the rock to your east.
Inside you can only see darkness, so it is possible that it is simply
a natural fissure, but then again, who knows?

sea air as a breeze ruffles your clothing.  You begin to feel a bit
better about your day - the sea can do that to a person.

You stand on a beach which stretches east and west from here.  The
waves, not very large at this time, lap gently near your, making
patterns in the fine sand.  To the west you see a few rocks jutting
from the sand and sea.  East is flat beach to the horizon.

it so you must watch your step.  You notice a bit of wood, partially
buried in the sand of the beach here.  West is more rocky beach, while
east the way gets a bit more flat.

Sandy Beach~
You stand on a sandy beach which runs along the shore east to west.  
To the east you can just barely make out the rooftops of a large city
which sits nestled in a cove on the shore of the ocean.  To your west
you see that the beach gets a bit rockier than where you currently
stand.  A set of steps lead up the cliff face just to the west of you.

another entrance into the city somewhere.  To your west, the beach

company of the Lighthouse Keeper and his family.  The dinner table
looks as if it always would have room for one more, the fire always
warm and comforting, and of course, Max would always be around to play
catch or get his ears scratched.  To the east, you see what looks to
be one of the family's bedrooms, the same to the west.  Both have
doors, but both doors are wide open.  A spiral stairway leads up into
the lighthouse top, where the Keeper must spend a great deal of his
time.

only be called the 'Lower Reaches', but also capitalized for a moment
- and then you see what lies below you.  Looking almost like a
medieval torture chamber, you see a room all in stone, a deep
cavernous hole in the center of it.  What looks to be am operating
table is set to one side with tables covered in instruments of
dissection and bubbling vials close by.  Do you really wish to descend
into that room and visit with the 'good' Lighthouse Keeper?

companion!  It seems the 'good Lighthouse Keeper' may be a bit more
than everyone believes him to be...

War schematics, and tactics are strung all over the tables in this room. You
also notice many maps of caverns and lands tacked on the walls, with pins 
sticking in areas of them. Perhaps the next crusade will take you to one of 
places, if you chose to go.
