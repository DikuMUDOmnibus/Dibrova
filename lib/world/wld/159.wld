Deep in the Kailaani Forest~
The forest in which you travel seems normal enough, despite the tales
of whoa which travelers bring from its depths.  Dry leaves crunch
underfoot, the occasional root snagging at your feet.

Wandering the Kailaani Forest~
Perhaps it is the lack of movement from any animal life or even the
forest itself that is what unsettles travelers so very much.  
Certainly everything else within the forest seems normal enough.

The Kailaani Forest~
The trees of this forest, fabled Nirin trees, tend to be much taller
than most.  They tower over one hundred feet in some cases, many times
so high that their tops cannot be seen.

Within the Kailaani~
Other than the creaks and moans of the tall Nirin trees all around
you, you hear nothing aside from the occasinal skitter of an animal.
The silence is somewhat unsettling, making your progress through the
forest sound that much the louder.

Dry Forestland~
The quiet of this forest is somewhat unsettling.  It almost seems as
if no wind blows through these lower reaches and perhaps that is the
case.  With the trees reaching such heights, most of the wind is
probably blocked by the hundreds of thousands of branches overhead.

The air in this forest is quite dry; a still, stale quality to it.  
High above, in the heights of the immense Nirin trees whic surround
you, you get the occasional glimpse of the wind moving the branches
but down here at the forest floor - nothing.

sticking with it seems the best way of getting through the forest to
open land.

it is hard to tell - it could have just been a deer run and nothing
more.

simply a natural lack of light due to the density of the foliage in

Never before has any forest grown to such proportions as the Kailaani,
having been allowed to expand as it likes and never logged by any
large city in need of timber.  More than likely, this is due to the
tales of death and dismay brought from this forest that is has been
left alone for so long.

Dark Area in the Forest~
The overhead branches are especially thick in this area of the forest,
letting very little light through.  It is not a sinister darkness,
simply a natural lack of light due to the density of the foliage in
the area.

The Kailaani Forest~
You travel onward, the forest around you hushed and ancient as if
watching your progress through and seeking to pass judgement for your
actions while you trespass.  It is easy to imagine eyes on your back.

Deep Within the Forest~
Never before has any forest grown to such proportions as the Kailaani,
having been allowed to expand as it likes and never logged by any
large city in need of timber.  More than likely, this is due to the
tales of death and dismay brought from this forest that is has been
left alone for so long.

Dry Forestland~
The quiet of this forest is somewhat unsettling.  It almost seems as
if no wind blows through these lower reaches and perhaps that is the
case.  With the trees reaching such heights, most of the wind is
probably blocked by the hundreds of thousands of branches overhead.

but down here at the forest floor - nothing.

A Small, Open Area~
This is one of many spots in the forest where the branches overhead
still blanket any chance at seeing the sky, but where no trees grow in
a small, open area.  This would probably be a good place to bunk down
for the night if it struck your fancy.

A Cluster of Thistles~
Wild bracken grows all over this forest, a large portion of it cluster
right here.  Thorns spike out from the spiney plant, threatening to
tear at skin and clothes if one is not careful.  Walk carefully.

The Endless Expanse of the Kailaani~
The forest never seems to end, tree upon tree upon tree upon tree
without respite.  Any direction seems as easily traveled as the next,
the trees growing fairly far apart from each other.

Among the Towering Nirins~
The Nirin trees, their trunks the size of small homes, rise up into
the sky brushing their upper brances with the heavens.  Travel appears
as safe and open in any direction you could choose.

Within the Kailaani~
You travel through the Kailaani, wondering what all the fuss is about.
In all the taverns and all the inns all over the world you have heard
tale of the dangers of the Kailaani.  So far, nothing of this forest
seems out of keeping with every other forest in the world.

The Neverending Kailaani~
The trees go on and on with no apparent end to them.  Shadows flicker
across your vision as the upper branches play with the light filtered
down through them.

/cyKailaani Roadway/c0~
The overhead branches are especially thick in this area of the forest,
letting very little light through.  It is not a sinister darkness,
simply a natural lack of light due to the density of the foliage in
the area.

The Kailaani Forest~
You travel onward, the forest around you hushed and ancient as if
watching your progress through and seeking to pass judgement for your
actions while you trespass.  It is easy to imagine eyes on your back.

/cyKailaani Roadway/c0~
Never before has any forest grown to such proportions as the Kailaani,
having been allowed to expand as it likes and never logged by any
large city in need of timber.  More than likely, this is due to the
tales of death and dismay brought from this forest that is has been
left alone for so long.

Hushed Forestland~
Your passage through the forest seems almost obnoxious in the wake of
the quiet that is such a natural part of this place.  Leaves grind
loudly underfoot, their extreme dryness making it all the louder.

Among the Great Trunks of the Nirins~
You wind your way among the trunks of the trees, those ancient Nirins
who's bark is said to hold magical properties which shield against
even the strongest of metals.

The Unending Forestland~
The forest goes on for what seems an eternity, your way through as
uncertain as a wave on the open sea.  Any direction appears as good as
the next, in fact every direction appears the *same* as the next!
