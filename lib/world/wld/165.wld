Deep in the Kailaani Forest~
The forest in which you travel seems normal enough, despite the tales
of whoa which travelers bring from its depths.  Dry leaves crunch
underfoot, the occasional root snagging at your feet.

Wandering the Kailaani Forest~
Perhaps it is the lack of movement from any animal life or even the
forest itself that is what unsettles travelers so very much.  
Certainly everything else within the forest seems normal enough.

The Kailaani Forest~
The trees of this forest, fabled Nirin trees, tend to be much taller
than most.  They tower over one hundred feet in some cases, many times
so high that their tops cannot be seen.

Within the Kailaani~
Other than the creaks and moans of the tall Nirin trees all around
you, you hear nothing aside from the occasinal skitter of an animal.
The silence is somewhat unsettling, making your progress through the
forest sound that much the louder.

Dry Forestland~
The quiet of this forest is somewhat unsettling.  It almost seems as
if no wind blows through these lower reaches and perhaps that is the
case.  With the trees reaching such heights, most of the wind is
probably blocked by the hundreds of thousands of branches overhead.

The air in this forest is quite dry; a still, stale quality to it.  
High above, in the heights of the immense Nirin trees whic surround
you, you get the occasional glimpse of the wind moving the branches
but down here at the forest floor - nothing.

One could wander this unbelievably large expanse of forestland for
days on end and never find the edge.  Traveling in one direction and
sticking with it seems the best way of getting through the forest to
open land.

It looks as if, at one time in the past, there may've been a path

it is hard to tell - it could have just been a deer run and nothing
more.

inner recesses of the tree dark and mysterious as you pass by.

Hushed Forestland~
Your passage through the forest seems almost obnoxious in the wake of
the quiet that is such a natural part of this place.  Leaves grind
loudly underfoot, their extreme dryness making it all the louder.

Perhaps it is the lack of movement from any animal life or even the

Certainly everything else within the forest seems normal enough.

probably blocked by the hundreds of thousands of branches overhead.

Never before has any forest grown to such proportions as the Kailaani,
having been allowed to expand as it likes and never logged by any
large city in need of timber.  More than likely, this is due to the
tales of death and dismay brought from this forest that is has been
left alone for so long.

Dark Area in the Forest~
The overhead branches are especially thick in this area of the forest,
letting very little light through.  It is not a sinister darkness,
simply a natural lack of light due to the density of the foliage in
the area.

The Kailaani Forest~
You travel onward, the forest around you hushed and ancient as if
watching your progress through and seeking to pass judgement for your
actions while you trespass.  It is easy to imagine eyes on your back.

Deep Within the Forest~
Never before has any forest grown to such proportions as the Kailaani,
having been allowed to expand as it likes and never logged by any
large city in need of timber.  More than likely, this is due to the
tales of death and dismay brought from this forest that is has been
left alone for so long.

Hushed Forestland~
Your passage through the forest seems almost obnoxious in the wake of
the quiet that is such a natural part of this place.  Leaves grind
loudly underfoot, their extreme dryness making it all the louder.

Among the Great Trunks of the Nirins~
You wind your way among the trunks of the trees, those ancient Nirins
who's bark is said to hold magical properties which shield against
even the strongest of metals.

The Unending Forestland~
The forest goes on for what seems an eternity, your way through as
uncertain as a wave on the open sea.  Any direction appears as good as
the next, in fact every direction appears the *same* as the next!
