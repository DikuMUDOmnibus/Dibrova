There are exactly six oaks in this grove, the rest is an open area
with scrub grass and wildflowers growing.  The grove lies to the
south.

Among the Wildflowers~
A more tranquil scene could not be imagined.  The ground underfoot is
of scrawny scrub brush but still somehow seems vivid in color and
almost soft in a wild sort of way.  Wildflowers poke their beautiful
blossoms up through the scrub, dotting the ground with a mariad of
pastel colors.

feeling that this grove may have been here longer than anyone might
expect.

might even be seperate in entity to the rest of the forest.

An Ancient Grove~
It is very obvious that this grove has been a part of the Kailaani for
centuries, tucked away in this remote section of the forest and kept
far from the destructive hands of the many mortals who might abuse its
beauty.  Most of the grove lies westward from here.

West End of the Oak Grove~
The grove spans out north and eastward from here, one of the six oaks
directly east from here, just a step away.  The Kailaani and all its
Nirins lies to the west and south, its darkness in stark contrast to
this grove and vivid colors of the wildflowers which grow within.

At an Old Oak~
You stand next to one of the six oaks of this clearing, all of which
are obviously as old as this forest - possibly even older.  The
feeling of contentment, security and even kindness that exudes from
the tree is awesome, almost majestic.

The Oak Grove~
This very peaceful grove spans out south and west from here.  It is
quite a large clearing in such a densely populated forest, a change
that is welcome after such a long trip through the trees in the
near-darkness that is characteristic of the Kailaani.

Bone-Strewn Glen~
Bones cover so much of the ground that you literally have to be
careful where you step, else you might trip on one of them.  Many of
the bones appear to be human or at least human-like.  Many of them
look to be very old, as if they might have been laying here for years
- others look not-so-old.

An open area of dead grass lies to the west, a welcome change to the

all of the ground.

very benign.  Obviously, from the number of bones scattered about,
there is nothing benign about this glen.
