Raider Fort Entrance~
You come to the entrance of the raiders fort.  Many raiders, children,
warriors, and scouts, come to see who has invaded their home.  The
fort is made of wood and stone, it is so solid that a catapult couldnt
even knock down its walls.  Although its walls are low, they are very,
very sturdy.

Raider Fort Hallway~
You walk down a clean and tidy hall, you can see that the raiders like
to keep their home clean.  The stone walls feel cold to your touch,
but the bright light of a torch makes you feel more at home, for now
anyways.

This is where the raiders put their guests, although they usually dont
have guests, once in awhile they will have the occasional guest.  
This room is made completely of wood, nothing here is stone.  It seems
as if this was a great fire pit.

behind you.  The long stone floor is cold to the touch, you think that
your shoes might just freeze to the cold floor, the walls are equally
cold.

advantages for flanking an enemy who has made it past the first wall
of defence.  The raiders themselves are really quite proud of their
little trap.  But so far in the history of raiders no one has ever
made it this far at all.

Royal Hallway~
You walk down the royal hallway, towards the ever cruel raider king.
The king isn't quite as mean as some of the other kings, but his
thirst for war makes him evil.  Most of the time the raiders are in
war with one group of people or another, they can't seem to stay out
of trouble.

Guard Room~
You walk into the first line of royal guards room.  These guards are
the first rank of guards which are responsible for protecting the king
from assassins.  Once in a long while a small brave group of raiders
will rebel against the king, but most of the time they don't make it
past this group of guards.

Guard Room~
You walk into a royal guard room.  Many guards stand at attention
peering past you at the royal hallway, making sure no assassin can
make it past them, it is very important for a soldier to protect his
king.  If one does not protect his king, they themselves will be
executed.

Royal Hallway~
You walk just north of the first guards post, and just south of the
second.  The king has lots of guards protecting him, getting to him
isn't easy.  Once you do get to the king, it still isn't easy, the
king raider himself is really quite the fighter.

Guard Room~
You walk into a very large guard room, many guards can be patroling
this area at one time.  Although the attack on the new king is really
quite common, the raider guards are usually loyal to their royal king.

Guard Room~
You walk into a guard room, most of the guards in this room are
actually napping.  They don't seem to actually care much about their
king, this room has most of the raider traitors in it.  The raiders
are glad that you were not one of the loyal raider guards, because
then they would be executed instantly.

Royal Hallway~
The raider forces are great troops.  They have won many a battle in
their day.  The raider king is one of the many commanders of the
military.  The king is unlike most kings, he doesn't sit back and
watch his commanders do all the work, he helps.

Royal Hallway~
The royal hallway is a warm carpeted hall.  Many raider guards march
back and forth down this hallway, it is very important for the guards
to be alert, not all of the kings people like him.  Many raiders
actually hate their king, for him sending off their good men to battle
every week, and day.

Royal Hallway~
The royal hallway that you walk on branches off to the guard rooms.  
These rooms contain the most guards, because they are so close to the
king.  This is the last line of defence for the king, not that the
king needs it, he is a very well trained soldier of war.

Many guards stand alert in this room, if any guard is caught sleeping,
or not paying attention, in this room, they are instantly killed.  
Many guards are killed every month, considering many of the killed
guards aren't even loyal to the king, most of the other soldiers agree
with the acts of the king.

You walk into the kings room, the room is full of scattered maps and
battle plans.  The king has a sword hung above his throne.  He is
truly the king of war, there are a few pictures of past kings, but all
the pieceful kings have been taken off the walls.  The raider king is
not very fond of anyone but his own people, everyone else is
considered a trader to him, and must be destroyed.  The king doesn't
take any prisoners, so he doesn't have any cells, all of his enemys
are executed, most of the time in public.  The king doesn't take any

Training Field~
You walk onto a field with soldiers fighting out their hearts, many
using wooden tools, but some using metal.  They train so hard the
occasional death does occur.  Raiders practice the art of war more
than any other race in the world, they would match the might of anyone
they meet.

Training Field~
You watch as the many soldiers training practice many different battle
tactics they were taught during the initial battle classes.  These
soldiers are the most educated in the category of war all around the
world, taking one of these lovely fellows on one on one, could be the
quickest way to ending ones life.

Training Field~
The flowing grass, and the creak of the trees, make you feel like you
are in a nice friendly forest, but when you look around at the chaos,
the sight is amazingly sick.  Tribes and other groups of soldier have
tried to end the pain and suffering that the raiders have caused, but
most end the same way, in defeat and slavery.

watching them train.  They fear no one, and nothing, not even death.

soldiers are scattered around, their training of battle tactics

You walk down a worn path, it travels around the training field.  
Many soldiers march this barren trail.  Soldiers who wish to be
trained are struck down by their own masters in the training field, if
you don't know your tactics, you shall not fight.

doesn't like war.

Room of Talisman~
You walk into the small marble room, this room seems to have been
constructed with more care then the rest.  The marble walls are laced
with some kind of magic protection spell.  The walls of this room are
covered with ancient pictures of old wizards and mages.  You scan the
rest of the room, you discover a small pot in the corner, only it is
not food which is being cooked.  The smell of rotten human flesh makes
you sick!  Your only instinct is to flee from the scene, but you know
you stumbled upon this room for a reason.

the middle shining with glory.  There are paintings on the walls
resembling a queen and her king.  The marble stones that the floor is
made of shines bright white, with a touch of darkness in them,
memories from the past.  There are candles hanging in the roof,
lighting up the room.
