presides.  The giant scrutinizes each captive and swiftly beheads those
presenting a glimmer of spirit.  The raiders mix and trade booty.  The

Across the Causeway~
   A spine of jagged rocks, topped with hard-packed earth, rides
across a narrow crescent of water toward twin blooms of black smoke.
Strong winds buffet the azure grey water.  Whorls of dust rise from
the causeway, revolving like wagon wheels.  The smoke is unaffected
by the wind, it ascends and ascends, black trunks supporting a canopy
of overcast sky.

shore.  A scrap of parchment crawls across the road bed until it lies
plastered against a rock.  A second gust snaps it into the water.
Twin chimneys rise from a grey fortress to the west.

Before the Rear Gates~
   A wide apron of stones emblazoned with a mosaic of azure stones
depicting a large wing-spread bat spreads before a dark porticullis
where there is almost certainly a squad of strong and ruthless guards.
The fortress rises to a neck craning height, a band of archers
loopholes running just above the porticullis.  A causeway, wide enough
for two wagons to pass with ease runs east across a large body of
water toward a band of green on the opposite shore.

The guards eat their fill.  Then they lean back, smacking their greasy chops.
Some of the guards haul out decks of cards, pipes and fat black cigars or
peg games.  Others wander off towards the sleeping quarters, to write a letter

a rough tunic and a pair of sandals then marched in front of the chief driver.
The chief assesses each and assigns him a duty.  A driver wielding a red
hot iron steps forward.  Two other drivers take the slave roughly by the arms
while the mark of the batwinged eagle is branded into his forehead.

either removing a weapon from one of the racks, or replenishing a vacant slot.
Another team, directed by an overseer, pack the weapons for shipment, then
shove the heavy crates onto a lift.

Beneath a Low Domed Rotunda~
   The floor is a sprawling mosaic in the shape of a compass, huge swords
describing the four main directions and smaller swords the rest.  A wide
marble stairway winds upwards along the walls to a mezzanine.  A low dome
adorned with a mosaic of a huge army on the march looms overhead.

Winding Marble Staircase~
  The stairway winds upward to the mezzanine.  Music and laughter lilt from
above.  Two soldiers, clad in shiny armour, flank the portal from whence
the gay sounds emerge.

Mezzanine~
   The low dome with its sprawling mosaic of a huge army looms over the
marble-floored balcony; close and oppressive.  Two guards clad in nickel
plated armour flank a set of double doors that lie wide open to the south.
The sounds of merriment, music and laughter, arrive from there.

GrosseSchmaushalle~
   Banners and ensigns bearing the crests of current visitors hang from the
stout rafters.  Tapestries depicting great battles, contests and feasts adorn
the walls. The south side of this large hall is crowded with large round
tables. A long table sits atop a dais that  runs half the length of the
southwest wall. A circular platform sits in the northwest corner; a bandstand
perhaps. Customers are feted here each night during their stay; filled with
excellent food and wines, and entertained until the wee hours of the morning.

Liquor Closet~
   Bottles and flagons containing a multi-colored array of liquors stand
in ranks on the shelves that rise above a small cupboard on the northern
wall.  Several large wooden kegs stand in a pool of beer at the southern
wall.

Glass Roofed Atrium~
   Dignitaries clad in splendid regalia, warrior chieftains, some in mufti
but their trade unconcealed, and merchants mill about the blonde panelled
room, inspecting the products of the factory below.  Tables laden with a feast
of swords, racks of brutal axes ring the room.  A mansard style roof of stained
glass caps the hall like a top hat.  Alternating panes of azure and violet
slope upward supporting a single crystal pane.  A seasoned warrior performs
in the box of light that decsends the effect of what is for sale.

Azure Carpeted Stairway~
   Frosted glass sconces set in the mahogany panelled walls broadcast a soft
white light upon the ascending corridor.  Batwing crests, woven into the
thick wool carpet, appear to fly in formation toward the room above.

Antechamber~
   Large paintings illustrating fierce battles hang in golden frames upon
the mahogany panelled walls.  A plush setee stands on the thick carpet
beneath each painting.  Two guards clad in nickel-plated armor flank the
mahogany door at the far east end of the room.

Viceroy's Office~
   An assortment of paintings adorn the mahogany panelled walls of the
office.  Several pieces of statuary rest on the acre of carpet between
the entry.  A clay pipe burns idly in a crystal ashtray that rests atop
a dark hardwood desk the size of a small boat.

A Harridan's Nest~
   The view is stunning.  You can see the top of the butte and beyond to
the curve of the horizon.  But what a racket!  The nest, constructed of
reeds, branches, bones and bits of metal you recognize as shards of armor
contains a clutch of hungry harridan chicks.  What if their mother returns?

Aboard the Packet Boat~
   The broad-beamed shallow draft boat is little more than a small
barge with a raked prow.  A rusty saw-toothed blade, bolted
to the bowspirit, extends down into the water.  A single mast carries
a sail decorated in the fashion of a carnival tent.  The boats' cat
occupies the only seat aboard.
