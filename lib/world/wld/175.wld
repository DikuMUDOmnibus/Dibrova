The Dancing Daemon Inn~
A huge circling wet-bar takes up most of the east end of the Daemon.
An old mage reclines against the mirror behind the bar absentmindedly
pouring several drinks at once with his refined telekinesis.  The
Lokettes, a local band, are playing their usual gig on the stage.  
The large booths along the all are filled with people drinking and
having a grand time.  You feel like partying here.  The only obvious
exit is to the north.
