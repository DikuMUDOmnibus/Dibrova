Rows of pews face forward giving their full attention to the pulpit
rising high above the ground.  The deep red carpeting underfoot shows
not a speck of wear or dirt.  It is obvious that New Thalonians take
religion seriously.

The Boyer/Fletchers' Guild~
The walls in this room are covered with pegs that hold various types
of bows.  There are few people working here, lending to the fact that
the skills are rare to come by in the general populas.  A few boys are
busy in the corner preparing feathers for the fine shafts used in
making arrows.  Some Elven craftsmen are carefuly inspecting each bow
as it is finnished.

There is no doubt that the Dwarves here know what they're doing.  
They have been invaluable in the building of this beautiful city.  
Here they are hard at work doing what they do best.  The hammers fly
in a blur as these talented craftsmen work the stone into ornate
bricks, pillars, trim, and many other forms.

through the palm trees, you see a delicate white gazebo.  A path leads
out into the hallway and west towards the gazebo.  To your right
