The Streets Outside the Dungeon~
You are making your way through the crowds to the entrance of the
infamous Deathtrap Dungeon, wherein you, along with several other
adventurers, will quest for fame, glory and, of course, gold.  Five
other adventurers are gathered outside, waiting for the Baron to begin
the Trial of Champions, at which point you will enter the maze, and
find your way through to the finish, at which point you will be
granted a fabulous reward!  Four of them enter before you- then its
your turn, and you stride purposefully into the dungeon, taking the
first few steps of what is known as "The Walk".

The entrance is flanked by two massive pillars, covered with carvings of

You shiver and decide not to think about what this portends...

Inside the Dungeon~
You enter into the gloomy interior, walking along a damp earth floor
that runs far to the north.  Presently, all exterior light has
dissipated, and you have to rely solely on your own light source.  
Water drips occasionally from the ceiling, the soft plop it makes as
it hits the floor echoing eerily in this stony tunnel.  Tiny insects,
disturbed by your light and noise, scurry away into many tiny cracks
and holes in the walls.  The sets of the footprints of those who
entered before you can be seen on the ground.

A Junction~
You have reached a junction, where you may proceed east, west or
south.  A white arrow on the wall opposite the southern branch points
west, and judging by the footprints several of your opponents decided
to follow its silent advice- three pairs head in that direction.  One
pair, however, heads east.

A Slimy Death~
You ignore all your instincts and proceed deeper into the pipe.  
Suddenly, you feel the pipe drastically change its angle, and you feel
yourself sliding very quickly down the sludge into a wide pipe that
goes down for over 50 meters.  You plummet screaming into the depths,
and land with a soft squelch in a lake of sewerage.  Dying, exhausted
and filthy, you have no option but to be grateful you are still alive
and recall.

A Gallery~
You are walking along a long corridor lined with hundreds of mirrors.
The sheer number of reflections you cast boggles you, and you barely
notice the presence of another, more sinister, traveller...  It is
only when you see a skeleton that looks like it has been half-dragged
into a mirror do you really begin to realize you could be in serious
trouble.  A staircase fashioned of skulls allows one to proceed upward
from this place.

corpses, and the air around you grows thick and heavy.  You gaze about
in panic and see that you are locked in a small room littered with the
bodies of those fooled before you.  Cursing, you realize that you have
been tricked by the Baron, and will have to recall and try again...
