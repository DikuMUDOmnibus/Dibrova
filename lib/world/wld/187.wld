Thewster's Main Square~
The Square strikes you as wide open and airy, not surprising
considering it is perched high above the ground in one of the great
Nirin trees in Thewster Forest.  All around you the town is alive with
the populous going about their lives.  Up, the road leads off to
Thewster's many shops, south is the Bay Leaf Inn.  To the east lies
the way back down to the forest.

There are some odd scratch marks all over the walls of the tunnels
here.  The only way out is north or deeper into the tunnels.

smell coming from the south.  The only exit is north and south.

stretch to meet each other high above your head, they also form an

The smell here is almost unbreathable due to the horrid smell that
seems to be all around you.  The cave floor is well worn from foot
traffic and leads east.

The stalagmites form a small room with exits leading east and south.
The exit south it blocked by a door, which seems to be the source of
the horrid stench.

You stand in what looks like a throne room.  In the center there is a
large rock and hung from the walls are animal skins of different
types.  The "carpet" is made up of decaying corpses and is probally
the source of the smell.  The only way out is north.
