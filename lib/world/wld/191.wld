Plains Road~
The wooden planks make an interesting clicking sound each time you
take a step.  On each side of the road small houses with green lawns
serve to house the excess population of Vern'ige, mostly refugees from
the war or Encar's conquests.  East is a gothic style building that is
Vern'ige's library.  It is two stories tall and has large gargoyle
statues at each corner.

bellowing from its chimney.  To the west you see a large marble

This type of boat is the de facto standard for fishing on Lagoon.  It

is dreadful as you walk down the narrow decks dodging swaying hooks

The Senate Chambers~
You stand within a large round room with a large number of seats
circling a smaller number of steats in the middle which are occupied
by the senators of the Alliance.  All the senators do is scream at
each other.  It makes you wonder how anything gets done...
