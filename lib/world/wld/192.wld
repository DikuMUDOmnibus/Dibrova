Vern'ige Park~
This area appears to be a park area of sorts.  Small gazebos and
picnic tables and benches line the edges of the road.  Looking up, you
see the dense canopy of branches.  This place is very tranquil and you
feel safe and at ease.  Beautiful flowers and ferns grow all around
you.  The scar of society cannot be seen here.
