A Grassy Field~
You are travelling across a great grassy field.  The wind blows
softly, causing the ripe ends of the grass stalks to bob lazily back
and forth.  To the north you spy what appears to be some sort of
temple, its great white walls blazing with the light of the sun.

Under the Arch~
Your eyes slowly adjust to the level of darkness under the protective
shade of the arch.  To the north is a great marble door, which seems
to be the best way to get inside the temple.  "Why the heck to I want
to go in there ?", you think to yourself.  You shrug your shoulders
and suddenly get the feeling that you are being watched.

The hallway makes a curve here to the west and the south, still
carpeted the entire way with the plush, red carpeting.  Mosaics hang
upon the wall, depicting holy crusades from a time long forgotten by
all but those who wove the mosaics in the first place.

The Light Temple~
The hallway curves westward, traveling deeper and deeper into the
depths of the Temple.  Everything within the Temple seems just a
slight bit more hushed than in the outside world.  Maybe it is because
of the reverance held by those who frequent these halls, possibly it
is simply because the floor is done in such thick carpeting.

The Light Temple~
The hall and the red carpeting ends at a staircase that leads upward
into the upper levels of the Temple.  No sounds come from above - you
get the feeling that is not normally a place that is frequented by
vistors to the Temple.

Hallway to the Bishop's Personal Chambers~
You stand atop a stone staircase in a short, narrow hallway which
leads directly east toward a door that is normally closed.  The
Bishop's personal chambers lie beyond that door, accessable only to
His Holiness.

Outside the Bishop's Chambers~
The stone floored hallway leads directly to a thick wooden door - the
door to the Bishop's personal chambers.  His chambers are considered
extremely off-limits to all the clergymen of the temple, it being his
only place for silent, solitary contemplation.

The Bishop's Chambers~
The walls of this room are white-washed and spartan with very little
in the way of personal comfort.  A single cross hangs upon the eastern
wall above a stained glass window.  Other than that there is only a
bed and a small night stand that doubles as a dresser.

The Light Temple~
Sconced candles surrounded by thin glass guards are mounted on the
wall giving illumination to the entire hallway.  The ceiling to this
place is curved in a domed, sculpted arch that lends to the feeling
that you stand within a place of great power and goodness.

The Light Temple~
The hallway ends here with an entry into the main chamber that is used
for services and prayer to the north.  A narrow hall branches off of
the southeastern wall of that room, heading off into an unknown place.

The Oratory of the Light Temple~
This main room holds space for literally hundreds of worshippers to
sit or kneel as they desire and offer prayer to the Gods of Light.  A
small hall branches of the east wall ending in a small, closed door.
The altar lies just north from here.

The Altar of the Light Temple~
Many sermons of great reverance and devotion have been delivered by
the Bishop from this altar.  The whole of the Oratory can be seen from
this vantage, a feeling of overpowering strength and glory runs
through you as you down upon what would be the assemblage if the pughs
were full.  The Oratory lies to the south.

A short, narrow Hallway in the Light Temple~
A small wooden door lies in the eastern wall of the hall, no sign or
markings giving any incling of what might lie beyond the door.  The
Oratory, in all its vast spendor, lies to the west.

Collapsed Basement~
The light here is very poor due to a recent collapse that has left
this area in ruin.  Chunks of rubble are strewn about, dust is thick
in the air making it hard to see and breathe.  It appears that there
is no way except back the way that you came - to the east.

The Light Temple~
The rubble is just as thick here as it is to the west, however in
addition to the dust that fills the air, there is also a strange
energy, almost a presence, in the air as well.  The source of this
energy comes from a shimmering sphere of light hazing in midair on the
far east wall.
