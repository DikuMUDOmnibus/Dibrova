The Forest~
As your eyes get used to the dimness, you can see a little way to
either side, a sort of darkened green glimmer.  Ocassionally a slender
beam of sun has the luck to slip in through some opening in the leaves

boughs and matted twigs beneath.

The Wooden Dock~
The dock ends here, but stretches quite aways east.  The smell of salt
is heavy in the air, as a large sea or ocean lies to the north.

A Wooden Dock~
The dock is made from large planks of Nirin wood lashed onto mighty
poles set deep into the bottom of Lagoon.  The smell of salt is heavy
in the air as Lagoon is a salt water lake.  Small crabs scurry around
on the poles in a search for the perfect tid bit or two to make a
lunch of.

You stand before a small wooden gate.  It looks more like it is used
for a border marker rather then to keep people in or out.  The forest

The crystal clear waters of Lagoon surround you and stretch out in all
of the cardinal directions for as far as the eye can see.  Looking
down you can see all the way to the sandy bottom, about twenty feet
down.  Small pieces of drift wood float around and bob gently in the
waves.
