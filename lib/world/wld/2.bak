Entrance~
   You stand before Saint Murphy's Church.  Looking up, you can see the grand
outer arc of the steeple.  In the steeple is a large bell.  You find it odd
that there are no guards or lookouts posted before such an obviously expensive
and grand palacial temple.  But then, you must admit that you feel a bit
peaceful, anyway.  Almost as if all the day's worries and cares have evaporated
and left you cleansed, ready for anything.

Rock Covered Path~
   This narrow path is covered with small stones and lined with large stones
which were obviously chosen with care.  Each stone is the exact same size,
shape and color.  Far to the west you see a dense forest, beyond which lies the
volcano that created this island.  The path continues east to the grand
entranceway to Saint Murphy's Temple.

Oratory~
   Empty pews surround you as you enter this place of worship.  You try to
remember your history but you can't, for the life of you, remember exactly what
this temple represents.  In children's stories you've heard wonderful tales of
Saint Murphy's adventures.  She, as a mortal, tamed Oryhip, the Dark Lord
protector, to allow the crusading mortals to defeat the powers of iK.  You
wonder how those stories for children represent the truth.  A set of marble
stairs leads up to the balcony where one can overlook the temple and the
services being performed there.

hear the faint music coming from all around you, and although you have been
moving almost constantly, you feel neither closer nor farther from the music's
source.

joining of hallways.  The walls seem so spotlessly clean that you have to
actually touch them to make sure that they are real.  Somewhere in the distance
you hear soft music being played, or maybe sung - it's hard to tell.

Top of Spiral Staircase~
   You stand at the top of the spiral stairs which lead down to the main temple
proper.  An ornate hallway leads east, turning south almost immediately.  The
walls here are all done in spotless white marble, the floors much the same.  
The light that filters throught this hallway comes from an unknown source, as
you see no windows from here.  Not that the light seems menacing at all, it
even gives you a sort of comfort, it's just a curious phenomenon.

Hallway~

runs for a short distance, ending at a meeting of halls.  The music continues
unabated, just out of sight, just out of reach, just far enough away that you
can't pinpoint the direction from which it comes.  A small staircase leads down
into the Oratory.

Balcony~
   The balcony looks out and down into the main room of the Temple, where St.
Murphy gives her benedictions and such.  A marble railing, thick as three of
your wrists, with fat marble posts encloses the entire balcony at about hip
height, giving you a safe, comfortable feeling about being so high up over
another room.  There is a long, low bench up close to the railing where one may
sit and enjoy the scenery or watch St.  Murphy and her daily miracles.  The
balcony stretches out to the north and south or you may leave west into a long
marble hallway.

Saint Murphy's Office~
   You can't help being impressed by Saint Murphy's exquisite taste in
furnishings.  Expensive-looking trinkets, no doubt from her crusading days, are
carefully displayed on delicate glass shelving.  Her desk is tidy and the wood
is polished to a high shine.  In fact, everything in this room seems to be
polished including the ceiling while is decorated with cut marble tiles.

fight.  What does this mean?

Scenic Lookout~
   The rocks here have actually given birth to a few small green plants, which
are currently in bloom with beautiful orange and white flowers.  You can see
most of the island from here, at least as far as that huge volcano will allow
you to see.  The volcano dominates your entire field of vision to the
southwest, all you are able to see is it's sheer cliffs rising toward it's
mouth.  To the southeast there appears to be some sort of church or temple with
a huge steeple rising up from it's front wall.  The only way out of here is
north through the boulders.

A Beautiful Stone Path~
   As you get deeper and deeper into this island, you begin to realize that it
is not the uninhabited rock you thought it might be.  The path here looks
almost manicured, as if someone or thing tended to it regularly.  The path
itself is made up of brilliant white stones packed neatly along the trees that
now some almost trimmed.  But this is a forest, isn't it?  Why would anyone
want to trim the trees?  Southeast of here you can make out a huge white marble
edifice.  It looks to be some sort of temple, from the steeple which rises high
into the clouds above the rest of the building.  The path heads west, as well,
back into the deep forest.

   The island forest is very dark here, the trees surrounding the path blocking
the sun out with their thick branches overhead.  You can here the sounds of
birds, at least you hope they are just birds, high up in the trees fidgeting
and hopping around.  Looking up into the trees, you notice a tall white steeple
rising out of the forest to the east.  To the west the path seems to get a bit
brighter, leading into more open forest.

no tools, no nothing.  To the west is the small perfect trail that leads back
to the temple's entrance.

As things stand now, the sides look way too steep and the rocks much too loose,
