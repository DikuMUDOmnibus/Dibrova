The Entrance to Sherwood~
You are standing on the western border of Sherwood.  This is a very
safe and relaxing place as you look upon the great forest.  A tall
tree stands here providing shade from the suns rays and shelter from
bad weather.  You look east to the legendary Sherwood Forest.  There
are rumors of bandits roaming these parts stealing from the rich and
giving to the poor.  To the far north-east you can see a lookout tower
of a castle poking through the lush forest.  To the far south-east you
swear you can faintly hear the sounds of church bells.  To the west is
a small, gurgling stream.

A Busy Intersection~
You are standing at the west road of Sherwood.  Birds fly high over
your head chirping happily.  The road is covered with all kinds of
tracks that have packed down the dirt.  To the north the path leads to
a rather large castle.  It is said that Prince John has the castle
fortified heavily.  To the east the trail gets dark and to the south
you see a white church with a large cross.

church in the distance.

A Dark Path Through Sherwood Forest~
Here on the trail the forest crowds around you hovering high above
you.  The shadows dance along the ground chasing away the few spots of
sunlight.  The wind rustles the leaves making an erie sound.  You feel
uneasy as you wonder what create of the forest might pop out from
behind a tree at any moment.  To the west the path gets brighter and
bigger.  To the east the trail continues.

a lot bigger from the outside.  To the north you see the entrance to
the church.  To the east is the monistary.  You hear chanting from all
directions.

who would live in such isolation is a monk.  To the west you see the

cold and support various species of fungi.  You hear the sounds of
water droplets hitting small puddles on the floor.  You'd rather not
be here too long.  To the north is a cell and to the south is the
guard room.  The stairs lead back up to the grand staircase.

was once a very beautiful village rich of culture and art.  Small
stone slats still stand where the ancient houses stood proud and
glorious.  Tales of the land say they made a deal with a dragon for
protection.  However, later they decided the dragon was taking too
much gold along with the King of Sherwood.  Today only small remains
of a past city reveal it's past.  The White Dragon still is rumored to
live here, guarding the ruins.

A Path Through Sherwood Forest~
You are standing in a path through Sherwood Forest.  This is a perfect
spot for a nap or perhaps even an ambush from the merry men.  Deep
tracks in the ground tell you that a wagon has been through here
recently.  To the north-east you see a large tree poking through the
forest, to the south you can barely make out a brook of some kind, and
to the far south-east you can here metal clashing and cheering.

At the Log over the Brook~

down into the bright blue water to the bottom.  You wonder why someone
needed a bridge in about a foot or two of water.  On the other side of
the brook you see a house.

At the Base of the Large Tree~
Before you stands the biggest and tallest tree you have ever seen in
your life.  Looking at it's base you guess it could house several
homes within it.  Looking up you notice a bridge made of vines and
branches.  A rope dangles from above in front of you.  You think
someone may live up there.
