Revelation.

"These are the words of him who has the sharp, double-edge sword.  I know
where you live -- where the Anti-God has his throne.  Yet you remain
true to my name.  You did not renounce your faith in me, even in the
days of Antipas, my faithful witness, who was put to death in your
church -- where the Anti-God lives."
