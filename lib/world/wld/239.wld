Great Southern Desert~
During the day, the sun pounds relentlessly upon the sand, which
reflects it up and could drain the life out of the careless
adventurer.  The night is equally challenging, as the temperature
drops so much that it would require more than a cloak to stay warm.  
Such a paradox provides all manner of creatures with an idea
environment - as the ones who hold an aversion to heat rest during the
day, only to come out at night to hunt for food; and vice versa.

Great Southern Desert~
The landscape does not change, and you can swear you have passed the
same rock.  During the day vultures fly high overhead in circles,
eager to look for their next meal.  There is little solace as the sun
sets, however, as the nocturnal animals begin their hunt for food as
well.

Border of the Great Southern Desert~
With each step southward, you are brought closer to the Great Southern
Desert.  Numerous slate gray rocks stick out of the sand.  Any
footprints are easily covered up by the wind, although it does not
seem to blow much here.

Great Southern Desert~
During the day, the sun pounds relentlessly upon the sand, which
reflects it up and could drain the life out of the careless
adventurer.  The night is equally challenging, as the temperature
drops so much that it would require more than a cloak to stay warm.  
Such a paradox provides all manner of creatures with an idea
environment - as the ones who hold an aversion to heat rest during the
day, only to come out at night to hunt for food and vice versa.

Oasis of Life~
The water is deeper in this section, sloping down several feet to a

the oasis and possibly the mouth of an unaware drinker!  The land
slopes upward to the north and west, an elevation too steep for the
water to overcome.

Lush Oasis~
The oasis begins to take shape to the southwest, appearing to be more
than merely a mirage.  A few palm trees, somewhat close to the south,
provide shade to any travelers unfortunate enough to cross the desert
during the day.  Stone buildings, made next to each other, mark the
small village of the Khull Kum; a group that has lived within these
lands for quite some time.

Great Southern Desert~
While a fair amount of sand is present, you notice a small lake to the
west.  While perhaps from a distance it could be mistaken as a mirage,
it is definite the water exists.  Unfortunately it is quite close to
the main land to the east, so perhaps it would be a good idea to
partake in a few deep sips before continuing on your travels.

A beautiful blue pool of water can be seen here, surrounded by the

north, changing a slightly different shade of color.  A series of thin
palm trees grow nearby, no doubt still alive due to the water from the
oasis.  The remainder of what used to be a wooden fence lies to the
east, some of the broken planks half covered in sand.

that is similar in temperature to the desert; intensely hot during the
day and quite cold at night.
