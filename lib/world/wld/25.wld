Atop the Rocky Outcrop~
You overlook a serene, lush valley, walled off by deep blackish-red
mountain peaks.  The two sights oppose each other yet seemingly meld
into one soul, like good and evil.  You look once again to the valley
below to see a wave of grass heading up the hillside, meeting the a
small path leading down from the mountain.  A few feet down from the
boulders in which you stand the path begins.

Climbing Some Boulders~
Climbing down the boulders is no small feat.  You struggle finding
handholds in the rock and balancing yourself at the same time.  A few
more feet and...  There you're down.  From here the path leads north,
though you may wish to be careful of rock slides, the surrounding
rocks look to be less stable than you would like.

An Obscure Mountain Path~
The path is littered with small debris of previous rockslides.  Most
of it is easy to move around and climb over but by doing so you find
yourself an ugly dusty red color, which doesn't want to come off
willingly.  Perhaps it will come off in the grass that lies aways east
of here.

An Obscure Mountain Path~
Walking along the path you realize that it's no more than a mere
trail.  This path has been so neglected and forgotten that you wonder
if anyone knows it's here.  That is if someone still lives in this
valley.  You kick a stone watching it skip along the ground, hoping to
get off this trail and closer to civilization.

An Obscure Mountain Path~
Well, it looks as if the trail is coming to an end.  Several types of
grasses have taken root and have covered most of the path to the east.
If you look closely enough you can still see part of the trail.  Your
best bet would be to continue heading east into the grasses.

Waist High Grass~
The path you HAD been following is now gone, no longer to be seen.  
You now wade through waist high grass trying to make sense of your
location.  Alas, all you see around you is more grass.  Far north, the
grass gets thicker and quite taller, a few inches above your head.

Waist High Grass~
You wade through more of the grass, plodding along, looking for a way

the tall grasses.

You have now, sufficiently lost yourself in this cursed grass.  Oh,
heaven help you if there were a flashfire right now.  OR, maybe not,
then you'd be able to find your way out, at least if you didn't burn
to death first.  Choose your path, either way you'll get lost, at
least you believe so.

Now this is more like it!  A large, solid road...  One which is pitted
and covered in long scratch marks.  Either this road is heavily
traveled or something VERY large travels alone these roads.  You do
not wish to discover either, especially the latter.  The road
continues to the east and west.

but only because it blends into the mountain so well.  The road
continues north, east and west.

The road is uniquely different here.  Instead of path marks following
the road so dilligently, the come from the north and the south curving
jointly into one path.  A path that heads west into the surrounding
grasses.  There is no explanation for it, although the grasses appear
to be bent and twisted suggesting that the troops destination was
somewhere off to the west.

Some Matted Down Grass~
You push your way through the grass once again, following the way from
the east.  Moving aside stalks of grass, you can faintly see the worn
path etched into the ground from the riggors of frequent use.  Just
shortly, ahead to the west, you can hear the clanging, grinding of

A Draconian Camp~
You plunge through the last of the grass stalks and roll out onto the
ground before a very large draconian soldier.  You look up, to see the
gaze of this beast fall down upon you and say, "You do not belong
here, LEAVE NOW before I gut you like the pig you are and roast you in
our fire pit.  " The creature turns and motions to several other
draconians and you quickly cower behind some ale barrels.  The
draconians turns back to your absent position, nodding in approval and
then marching off westward.

A Draconian Camp~
Keeping an eye out for the unfriendly inhabitants of this camp, you
head deeper into the darkness of the camp.  Tents are scattered
haphazardly around the area in complete disarray.  It is strange that
it would be that way in a militaristic camp, but then - these are
draconians.  Just west of your current place of cowering concealment,
you spy a large fire pit, which seems to dominate the center of the
camp.  You can see a great many shadowy figures all crouched around
it, eating or drinking or just making the guttural sounds that
draconians pass of as speech.  You can leave this awful place to the
east.

The Fire Pit~
These evil beings congregate around the fire, drinking their terrible
brews or eating whatever it is that they eat - you'd rather not know.
With the light of the fire making you easy to spot, it's hard for you
to find places to hide from these creatures.  You notice that north,
south, and west of you there are many large tents, their interiors
dark and sinister looking.  To the east you can attempt your escape
from the camp.

A Barrack Tent~
   Normally, in a military environment, a barracks tent would feature
neat rows of cots, all of them kept indentically perfect.  Here in a
Draconian camp, there are not even cots to keep orderly, only a few
grubby blankets and the dirt floor which the tent was erected on.  It
looks as if there may have been someone (or thing?  ) here very
recently, evidence of a hasty departure is all around you.  To the
east is another section of the tent, south is the fire pit.

This is where the camp keeps most of it's spare weapons, food, and
general supplies.  Not a surprise at all, there appears to be a severe
lack of any inventory at all.  A few crates and chests lie scattered,
all of them looking extremely empty.

Make-shift Stables~
This disgusting room reserved for the cavalry of the...  Army?...  
Holds whatever livestock they were able to steal or loot.  The room,
not even divided into stalls, looks to have been left uncleaned since
the day it was erected, which looks to have been some time ago from
the amount of droppings all over the floor.  There are, at least, a
few decent steeds here - one in particular looks like quite the
warhorse.  There are exits both north into the camp or west into
another section of tent.

The Command Tent~
A long, low table covers most of the area this tent has to offer.  
Scrawled and scribbled on pieces of crumpled parchment lie scattered
all over the table, most probably the Draconian's plan for invasion
into some human realm.  There is another section of this tent to the
west, a larger, wider room.  Just outside the door to the east is the
firepit, where you will surely be spotted if you try leaving thru the
main exit of this tent.

Scah'lyyn's Tent~
This would probably be opulent in Draconian standards, but the filth
which covers most of the luxuries in this room only makes you want to
retch.  There is a low, wide desk in the northwest corner of the tent
and a wide cot.  Remains of past meals lay scattered on the floor,
along with old tattered clothing which became unwearable.  The only
exit you see from here is back through the command tent to the east.

following westward, you don't see any coming from that direction
though.  Maybe, they were just as glad as you to leave this forsaken
place.

stomach.  Why were there no boot prints coming from this direction?

There is a smaller amount of prints heading up this direction.  You

the edge of the road don't seem quite right.  Almost man sized, placed
precisely a few feet apart from one another encasing the trail
northward.  You approach one of these stones, which almost look like
humans, yet...  Nah, it couldn't be...  It just couldn't.

footing.  The path continues up and south.

one.  Great evil lies ahead, to cause such a thing.  "Toto, I don't

You pull yourself up onto a narrow ledge, barely room enough to walk
on.  Wherever you are headed, this place was not meant to be found or
traveled by anyone.  A lightning bolt races across the sky, disrupting
your attention and almost making you fall.  You hope that, that
doesn't happen again.  The ledge heads east and west.  To the west is
the base of a huge tower.

You are at the entrance to an ENORMOUS cave, big enough to hold the
most monsterous of vile beasts.  From the looks of things you are not
welcomed here.  Two columns of skulls lie just inside the mouth of the
entrance, you do not wish to become the newest part of that group.  
Beyond the grotesque pillars, looms absolute blackness, no light seems
to penetrate inward or even escape outward.  Enter at your own risk.

somewhere from the opposite direction, to the west.  A loud clanging
sound can be hear, like swords smacking together.  Either way, the
directions don't look encouraging.

few steps forward and you feel some thing crack under the weight of
your boot.  You shine the light downward to examine what you had
stepped on, it is an egg.  Bending down to get a closer look you
notice that these were NOT of the bird family, but it was a dragon
egg.  A small 'snap' echos through the room, then a 'crack', then more
noises accompany, those faint first sounds.  A horrible thought
crosses your mind.  The eggs are hatching.  You could escape west of
here or try your chances south.

Dragon Breeding Chamber~
The sounds echo even more in this part of the cave, it's almost
deafening.  As quickly as the noises began, they stop.  Two glowing,
silver eyes appear out of the darkness, watching you intently.  The
eyes begin moving toward you, accompanied by a soft gentle breeze.  
The eyes turn suddenly to the left.  You focus in on those eyes,
turning your head then your body to follow them as they move around
you.  The eyes circle you once, twice, three times each time gaining
in momentum.  The gentle breeze that was apparent earlier has now been
replaced by a vortex, slowly sucking the breath out of you.  Dizzied
by the effect you fall to one knee gasping for air.  The eyes slow
their pace until finally resting in front of you once more.  You sense
that this was just a warning, and that you had better leave.

The Draconian Training Camp~
Young draconian trainees are sprawled out about the place, practicing
the art of war.  Some are standing others are left breathless on the
ground, but never the less all are practising.  A camp task master
spots you and yells to the recruits, "That is your enemy, best him,
and you shall be TRUE draconian soldiers!  " The recruits look up from
whatever they are doing and bare gnarly fangs.  All charge you, but
the task masters' whip slices through the air, "ONE at a time, whelps,
only ONE at a time!  " Your best bet is to flee northward.

still flee east.
