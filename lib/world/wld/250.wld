   This is the home of Demion, a fierce and mighty killer.  Excess
bones and body parts are carelessly scattered and have started to pile
up in the corners.  Blood is sprinkled everywhere forming various
interesting partterns.  A lone light glows from high above in the
ceiling, and is barely powerful enough to illuminate the otherwise
completely dark room.

just east of Midgaard Field.  As you look out at the arena, you can
spy two people fighting in a bloody, gory duel.  West is the Great
Field of Midgaard, to get east, you'll have to talk to the Arena
Master.

You are standing in the doorway to the home of Oddjob, The Mighty Monk
and Gorbundrel Bantle, the powerful cleric.  I hope you are welcome
here because the owners don't like trespassers, better ask permission
before proceeding.  If you are here to Ophelia, just knock 69 times
and she will be here shortly.  She has to clean up, you know.  If you
are here by accident, then LEAVE!  If you are here to see either
Gorbundrel or Oddjob, then you are outa luck, because they are both at
work.  Down would be a terrible mistake is you are not a member of
Genocide...  Punishable by death!

This charming little mudroom has braziers and panties scattered everywhere.  Oddjob doesn't often come by here so Ophelia feels free to bring here boyfriends here.  She only wears the lingerie to seduce, after that, she has no use for it.

A sparkling hallway.
Ophelia believes that since this room doesn't make sense that she can not be found here.  She is not to bright.  This room is stocked with marijuana, booze, comdoms, sex toys, even Cokaina.  This bitch is in business!!!  
Ophelia has served a countless number of Dibrovans here. Oddjob, Baker, Lutheruin, Lord and even the cold-hearted Rapax to name a few.  Gorbundrel sees her like a little sister, so he has never done the bitch.
If you are here to see Ophelia you must be feeling lonely.  Keep in mind it is temporary, because this bitch is mainly for fucking and thats it!

A Sparkling Hallway~
This is Ophelias bedroom.  Ungodly acts of lust stain the walls and the smell of sex seems to occupy your mind.  This Ophelia must have some sexdrive.  You guess that she is probably in her thirties or is raking it in.  
Ophelia is a prostitute that loves her job.  I believe she does 10 men a day and Oddjob has no clue, so don't tell him!!
Gorbundrel is sickened by her profession, but he loves her like a daughter, what can he do?  Gorbundrel would ANNIHILATE anyone who put her down.  Oddjob would ANNIHILATE anyone who smiles at her.
Oddjob is so whipped!

Beginning of house.  The hallway opens up into an empty room.  There
is a doorway to the east, it looks like another big empty room.  The
entrance to the house of O&G.  If you are lucky you can catch
Lutheruin banging Ophelia here in the main hall of the house.  
Lutheruin is a shady little man and Ophelia is just down right horny!
If Oddjob even caught wind of this it would be Lutheruin's execution.
Luckily, Oddjob is as blind as a bat and beleives everything his
lovely little slut tells him is the truth.  Lutheruin secretly plans
to take everything Oddjob calls his own.  He just doesn't know how
yet.  Gorbundrel will ultimately group with Oddjob against any attack
on his life/material life/love life....  The pussy-whipped fool.

Marguis and Ophelia used to escape to this room.  They were lovers to
the fullest extent.  Gorbundrel didn't like his closest companion,
Marguis, getting it on with a whore and Oddjob hated seeing his
so-called women with a dirty evil-bastard like Marguis It's a tearfull
sight to see the love between Marguis and Ophelia when they are forced
to be in the same room with each other and can't even make eyes for
fear of jealousy and abandonment.  It's a tearfull sight to see the
love between Marguis and Ophelia when they are forced to be in the
same room with each other and can't even make eyes for fear of
jealousy and abandonment.  There is a musky smell to this room.  
Ophelia musta stank!!

This cluttered room is where Oddjob likes to keep all his junk.  If
you are a guest in the house, feel free to pick through this heap of
junk.  Gorbundrel would like to see this room cleaned up a little.  
Oddjob needs to clean his room.  Ophelia and Suz can usually be found
making lesbian love to the north and if you're lucky Grolch may be
there to.  I wouldn't suggest interupting them, but stop and watch for
a bit, Gorbundrel usually does.

Living room.~
This is where Ophelia waits patiently for her man.  There is a young
girl here walking on rose petals.  She smiles at you and asks,"May I
help you to your chamber?  " This young cleric often gets restless
waiting for Oddjob and there has been suspition Talk that is, of her
being courted by another man, another monk at that!!!  Baker always
was a ladies man.  Best not to ask Oddjob about it because he has
quite a temper.  Baker believes that he can overcome Oddjob and get
his wicked lay in the process.  Baker plans to first take Ophelia for
his own, leaving Oddjob beat-down and just plain hummiliated Word has
it that Ophelia has the deedest throat in all of Dibrova and loves to
show off.  Making her the most desired woman in the world.  Problem
is, Oddjob is one of those crazy boyfriends that even when she leaves
him, he doesn't understand.

Aboard the Xephyr~
The ship is huge, her sails seemingly reaching the sky.  The deck is
clear and the ropes are neatly stored out of the way.  Three massive
masts, each carrying three sails apiece, creak and groan against the
pressure of the wind upon the sails.  The figurehead upon the prow
seems to point the way to the promised land.
