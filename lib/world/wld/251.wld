The Hall of Bones~
This is the west end of a hall littered in bones, dried blood and
ashes.  A feeling of immense dread, of evil incarnate, lies at the
east end - almost beckoning to you.

Before the Throne of The Dark One~
Waves of pure evil radiate from the throne room which lies to the
north of you.  The entire northern end of the room is shroud in a
blanket of darkness so thick that only the darkest of souls would feel
any sort of condfidence within it.

The Throne of Ultimate Evil~
A massive, pitch black throne lies squarely in the center of the
northern wall, radiating an evil majesty that is unmatched anywhere
else in the world.  Kneel, puny mortal - and bow your head to the
Master of Evil.
