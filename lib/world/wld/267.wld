Barren Void in the Plane~
This gaping void on the Plane is barren and empty of any stimuli.  
This place was constructed by the powers that be to serve as a
confinement for those found to be uncontrolable.  Absolutely nothing
of interest lies here.

small casket-shaped hole lies in the back corner of the chamber.

throw-pillows lie scattered about.  A velvet-lined casket lies in the
back of the chamber, just out the reach of the light.

The landscape is bleak and dreary.  Nothing seems to be out of the
ordinary save for some tangled briars which seem to be hiding an
elongated object of some sort.  During the night, strange sounds can
be heard here, more so on moonlight eves.

A Secret Burial Chamber~
A heavy mist, rising from the damp ground, floods this chamber.  The
air is cold and damp, uncomfortable to most.  In the center of the
chamber lies an open crypt.  The crypt is covered with a forgotten
form of writing and glows softly from patches of luminescent fungi
which grow upon it.

The Pit~
Jagged spikes jut out from all sides of this underground cavern.  
Fate has allowed you to fall inside safely.  Bones litter the ground
as the remains of corpses hang impaled on spikes here and there.  A
small, frost-shrouded clearing, devoid of spikes, lies in the middle
of the cavern.

A Tear between Chaos and Order~
All is silent and still here, even time has no meaning for those who
find this special place.  Being in here is like drifting in the void
inside of a glass cube.  Mystical scrolls and tomes float about, some
open and magically recording events in history.  Illumination is
provided by starlight which escaped the vacuum of the void.
