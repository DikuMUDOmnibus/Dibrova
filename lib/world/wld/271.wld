The Entrance of the Dream~
Emerging from the waterfall portal, breathless imagining the wonders
that could be beyond your sight.  You now stand on a barren,
desert-like cloud, which depresses slightly underneath your weight.  
This vast expanse awes you, but you see something to the east, west,
north, and up.

The Field of Dreams~
As you leave the relatively sane portal entrance, your external and
internal sense become bombarded almost immediately by seperate,
totally beautiful ideas which you suspect is only a microcosm of the
entire place.  You "see" a tree growing out of its roots, branches
waving in the breeze.  You "smell" everything nice youve ever smelled,
wrapped up into one burst of feeling.  You feel the likes of soft
silk, or of stroking a body with perfect skin, gently.  You taste all
the wonderful foods youve ever tasted--of recipes that once existed
but are gone forever, of your mother's soup as she brought it to you
when you were sick.  And finally, you hear all the wonderful things to
hear--Of beautiful lake-side nymphs, tittering in their innocence, of
two lovers breaking a sustained kiss.  You feel you could simply lie
down and wra yourself in these emotions until the day you die.  Exits
lead east, north, and west.

A Vast Expanse of Cloud Cover~
You wander out of the strange portal into the room directly north of
you.  Almost as if walking through a thick door, the utter vastness of
this new room astounds you.  You can't even hope to see the end of it,
no matter how far you look.  Its simpy enourmous!!  Exits lead in all
directions.

The Cheery Path Before the Cottage~
You step onto a well worn path that extends into a coatto some 30 feet
hence.  This small path is extremely pleasant, as the purple
over-hanging trees filter light through their square leaves, and the
lions have just woken up to sing their morning songs as they flit
about the tree.  Around you on the path are shrubs, little stalks of
grass, and...  As you lean closer, you discover it isin't grass--It is
chewing into your hand.  Exits lead east, west into the cottage and
north.

You wander up from the portal into the lair of the not-so-terrible
cousin of the Newbie Monster.  Instead of bones, you see balls and
toys lying around, and instead of attacking you, hes trying to get you
to play!  The lair itself is small, and the monster is even smaller.
He has short green fur, and 2 blunt teeth.

Inside the Cottage~
This hut is a homy, warm, comfortable looking little abode, with a
large stone fireplace, small rickety bed and a rotting rocking chair.
In that chair, you see an extremely old goat, sitting upright, somehow
knitting a scarf.  The material she is holding obscures her hoofs, and
prevents you from divining how she is actually holding it.

Avoiding the cottage, you veer north onto a small path which seems to
be made out of a sticky green substance.  As you advance further into
the "forest", you see what you mistook as trees were really bristles
on large, silver hairbrushes.  And some animals seem to be sweeping
about in the trees as well.  The path leads north and south.

The Sub-Conscious Mind~
As you step into this room, yet another memory/emotion overcomes you.
You are experiencing someone elses life.  You are a mortal, young, and
have a healthy greed for power.  As you get older and aquire more
power, you are voted a demi-god by your followers.  Now, you want even
more.  You displace a leading god, and quicky assume that position.  
You are now on par with the other gods.  And yet, it is still not
enough.  Eventually you manage to form the gods into a panthenon, with
you as the leader.  You now have ultimate power--but you are still not
happu with your position.  You come back into this world as the vision
fades into the present.

However, at the bottom of the mountain you see something faintly
glowing in an unholy light.  Exits least east, west, south, north and
down.

Concepts~
You sidestep the inverted mountain and enter the room to the east.  
Knowledge permeates your pores, flooding you with concepts never even
thought of, let along practiced.  Of destroying monsters, cities, even
Worlds with something called an "anti-matter reaction".  You try to
make sense of the wisdom that is flooding you, but you can barely
grasp concepts, let along specifics.  You somehow know wherever you
are, There is someone here who is supremely more powerful than you.

As you sidestep around the inverted mountain and come into the room to
the west, you find yourself standing on the "ceiling", staring down at
the floor.  Thats not all thats backward--You notice your body itself
beginning to invert itself and bone to poke through the skin.  The
monster that stumbled in here seems to be feeling the same thing, and
dosen't look to pleased about it either.

You step into yet another medium sized room.  The room is grassy, with
a feeling of utter peace and calm.  The wind rustles through your
hair, and a beautiful crystal lake laps gently at the short.  Only one
thought squeezes inside your skull: Siddharta.  You have no idea who
or what it means, but you feel it represents power and knowledge.

strangely familiar room.  You see now there is no way you can climb
back up these slick, shiny walls.  The only exit is down.

this room, the forest behind you seals off and new pathways open up.
This room is bright, with sunlight streaming down through distant
treetops, making interesting patterns on the floor.  However, the
monsters in here arent so natural.  You see horribly disfigured
daggers that seem to sprout small limbs and mouths.  Exits lead east,
west and north.

untold answers and soon to be asked questions.

You wade your way through a seemingly endless barrier of ethereal,
blinding fog, penetrating it in less time that you thought you would
spend.  You have arrived at a suprisingly familiar place, and every
step seems to be a re-enactment of some sort, a constant deja-vu set
into motion.  Searching deep within your memories, you succeed in
finding the hidden corner that corresponds to the scenery before you..
And the view metamorphosizes into something else altogether.  Your
mouth gaping wide in shock, your senses gradually become accustomed to
the sudden change, and once again you deel the nostalgic familiarity
from the beginning...  As you wander through the mnemonic diary of
your lifetime, you are suddenly swallowed up by a burst of cold,
unearthly mist, and transported to a different place.

grave, with a young man paying homage to some lost soul, obviously
important to him.  The mans face is familiar, but you can't quite
place it.  The young man places flowers on the grave, and steps back,
tears rolling down his cheek.  Even admist the thunder and rain, you
sense a feeling of peace and devotion radiate out from the man,
encompassing all there is see.

magic.  Just as the bleeding begins, a heavy, metal boot smashes into
your now-opened wound, causing pain to echo within every corner of
your body.  The fall to the ground means nothing.  Your pain is
intense, yet when the scalpel begins to slowly flay your flesh, you
realize that death is all you could possibly ever want.  Finally, a
heavy flail is brought into play.  What was once called your legs now
become what most call jelly.  Finally, an axe severs your ligaments
and bone while your head is beaten in with your own arm.

Smallbody, and is one of the first concubines Sunes Demi-god took.  
She seems to have been recreated by a small part of a sub-conscious.
Still, she seems luscious, and looks up at you with hopeful,
tear-stained eyes.  She wears A collar, chained to the wall.

The Hall Before the Chamber of Bellion~
You step into a medium sized chamber that is made of onyx and black
paint.  To the north, you see a black door with black bars and an evil
sound eminating from behind it.  The walls seem to glow in an unholy
light, as if just the presence of that being behind the door causes
them to become evil.

Maligranda~
As you step into this room, a stench overcomes you--about the time the
blast of flame strikes you.  Maligranda is huge, metallic, and emits a
crunching sound as he stomps around his room.  He seems to be emitting
some sort of foul odor, and jets of fire emit from his nostrils.

Lost the Confused~
You step into the room, expecting to sweep some beautiful person into
your arms, and...  You find a small elf, playing with emotion magic.
He tells you his name is lost, and he IS lost.  He needs his belt to
get back home, and can you please help him?  Hes really a cute little
fellow once you get over the knife hes grabbing with vigorous
anticipation.

A man is here.  He is of average stature, slightly muscular, and has
light brown hair.  Still, as you walk in the room, you fall to your
knees, and bow your head in worship.  He smiles gently, and touches
your head.  Immediately, you scream out in pain.  You feel as if you
are being violated over and over, or like a snake is eating you from
inside out.  You feel dirty, unclean and hurt.  When you look up
again, You see nothing, except yourself--cold and shivering on the
barren stone floor.

A very powerful thought eddie strikes you as you enter this room: This
is the home of the gods dream you are exploring!  You look around in
amazement, awed at being able to witness this directly.  The smell is
"dinner", and the snuffling sound is a pet pig Narel kept.  The house
is rather large, uncommon for these times, but you see his family was
somewhat wealthy.  Exits lead up to the second floor, and east to the
dining room.  West and south are blocked off by doors.

covering the floor in the manner a carpet does.  A large bed is half
covered with junk, and a wooden cabinet off in the corner is almost
complete buried, overgrown with things bought but never used.  The
thought eddie relates to this room.  It was his, when he was a mortal.
The thought fades out, but the room remains.  The magic seems to be

his now ever-present quest for power.  Higher, and higher Narel climbs
as he destroys god after god, reaping in their followers.  You realize
he spoke to the lord of death, and sold his compassion, purity, and
all good for the ability to gain power quickly and efficently.  The
thought slips out of your soul, and you are left alone.

both the whip and the voice would crack down upon him.  Chorkle is

of the hallway south.  This section of the Dream is very intense.  
Already, you are picking up bits of thought-currents from adjoining

As you approach Narel, you sense his presence becoming stronger, and
the thought eddies are lasting longer than ever.  Yes, even the mighty
Narel once possessed Innocence.  He knew nothing of war, or plague, or
famine.  His mortal family was rich, and coddled him.  You relive his
childhood, until you see his wife-to-be bought, raped and murdered.  
The eddie vaporizes itself, and you are left to mull over the
implications.

his body.  You gaze down upon your gods, who have begged to have a
meeting with you.  Now Bane, a representative of the lower gods steps
forward.  Narel, the shadow upon the heavens and earth...  We Address
you.  Suddenly, a well-rehearsed chant eminantes from the assembled
mass of Gods.  "You may be able to kill some of us, Narel, but not
all.  We can and will displace you if you do not remedy your ways.  
We proffer a deal.  " You ponder for a bit, listen to their demands,
and acede to them.  You must sleep for an eon, where you may ponder
the correct way to rule.  You graciously step down off the throne and
allow a new temporary high-god to rule in your place.  He waves his
hand, and you are banished to a chamber...  You awake out of the
dream-state, muddled and confused.

it is the presence, but yet it is difficult to remind yourself of
that.

Something has Gone Wrong. . .~
Congratulations.  You have just taken the first step toward killing
yourself: Hopping off of a 1000-foot cliff onto a jagged, rocky seabed
below.  However, instead of impaling yourself on some stone party
hats, you seem to be free floating in some sort of limbo-type air.  
You seem to be able to swim through the ether with ease, and you are
beginning to feel somewhat light-headed.  The cliffside stretches back
to your west, and to your north you see a large, ominous portal that
stretches across the sky like some temporal gash, so out of place that
the very sight induces feelings of queasiness and death.  Choose
wisely, young adventurer.

A Secret Spot High up in a Banyon Tree~
Another though penetrates your mind as you enter this room.  You are a
child, 8 years old, hiding from his mother and father after breaking
his sisters toy.  You are in a banyon tree, a tree with wide-spread
branches, comfortable and peaceful while allowing you to remain
undetected.  The two main fears of Narel are heard...  His mothers
voice and the cracking of his fathers whip as they search for him to
inflict punishment for a mistake.  You relax, smile and wait for the
rage to pass...

complete idea.  It seems Narel is very, very close to here, and his
immense thoughts are radiating outward like ripples on a pond...  Yet
ripples cannot kill.

You step into this room, expecting to perhaps inhabit a body...  But
instead you are subject to the presence itself.  Some mystical force
keeps your head bowed down as you are examined.  Your body, armor,
soul...  All is tweaked and pinched, and finally the presence fades
out and leaves you in a stone, earthy room with a faint light hovering
in front of you.

You are elated within this host, and feel a wrenching as the scene

The Passage to the Mighty Narel~
You continue walking down the long passageway, complete with arched
ceilings and marble floors.  You see more rooms to the east, fairly
pulsing with the contained energy of Narel and his thought eddies.  
Stone columns extend from floor to ceiling, giving this section of the
hallway a majestic, archaic look, stoic in its representation.  To the
south, you see a glowing, pulsing light.

Narel, Adolesence~
Entering from the branch of the hallway, you are thrust into a host.
Of course, by this time you are an old-hat at this.  Casually, you
look around and see whats going on.  You are Narel as a teenager, the
thought thinks to you.  You relive years in minutes as you experience
your first major bone break, first sexual experience, and first major
schooling that expands your mind as you begin to wonder...  The
thought fades out, leaving a shell of Narel as a teenager.

Narel, Adult~
Adulthood...  As you step out of the hallway, you are thrust into an
adult host.  With a shock, you realize this never happened.  This is
what could have been, had Narel not joined Sune in the ranks of the
heavens.  You stare on in wonder as, for the first time, you have the
control of the host.  You know it is fruitless, but you shape his life
like a god, over come with power even at this small bit of control you
have.  Finally, the thought leaves your soul and you are left standing
in an empty, bare room...  Except for the Adult Narel.

The Passage to the Mighty Narel~
As you walk down the passage, it continues to change.  Now the walls
flow with nectar, rich and pure and sweet.  The floors are still hard,
yet radiate patterns of totally entrancing light, and you are unable
to keep your eyes off them.  On the ceiling is all the colors of the
universe, arranged perfectly to make them beautiful.  This is a
wonderful room...  Do you want to leave?

The Entranceway to the Chambers of Narel, the Mighty lord~
You step out of the long hallway, and enter a new room.  To the east
and west, you see both Sacrifice and sleep, and to the south you can
make out a pulsing, holy light which can only be the actual
Present-day Narel, deep within sleep.  This room is actually very
plain--gods have no need of jewelry or fancy furniture--and Narel is
the high-god of All.

Narel, God~
This is it.  You are finally in the beginning of Narel's true reality.
You watch as Sune floats to the ground, envelops you in a cloak and
gently takes off to induct you into Godhood.  You sit at a temple,
enjoying a glass of nectar, though nervously as Sune has been watching
you for the past 10 minutes.  Then she speaks.  "You have potential,
Narel...  I want to exploit that potential, so we ca eventually
collaborate as equals.  However, you will have to do exactly what I
say...  Do you agree?  " You nod emphatically, and she waves her
servants away.  Suddenly, she draws you toward her and grasps your
arms.  Suddenly, power is coursing through your body as your mortal
shell explodes, and a new godly shell is inducted through your soul.
Of course, by this time youve blacked out, but the thought remains, in
the shape of a motionless God.

A Jagged, Rocky Seabed~
If youre down here, either you a) fell to a bloody death, or b)
floated down here using your fly spell.  If youve chosen B, continue
reading.  This rocky, cliffside seabed is comparable to those B-rate
horror movies, with the flashing lightning and pouring rain.  You see
numerous rocks, all black and jagged, wickedly protuding spikes
jutting out of them.  A rather violent wave crashes against the
cliffside, spraying cold, salty water edged with the feeling of death
and demise.  The limbo above you seems more comfortable than this
salty hell.

The Final Chamber, Sleeping Place of Narel, the Mighty All-God~
You swim your way through an endless, totally misdirecting barrier of
ethereal chaos.  You are in the void.  Time and space have no meaning,
here, and you feel your senses slowly slipping away as your frail,
mortal frame drifts in the essence of entropy, forever spinning the
chaos to create some semblance of order.  Images flash through whats
left of your mind order, clawing at your sub-conscious barriers and
hacking through your soul with quivering blades of bloody flesh.  
Your very essence is becoming Chaos, as your mortal mind cannot grasp
the whole, but simply creates analogies to rationalize the total truth
to your simpering psyche.  A flash, and you are again drifting in
light, beams of it spearing deep within your body, penetrating you in
ways you have never thought possible.  You begin to get a small sense
of your mortal shell as you slowly drift out of chaos, something
unconquerable by even the mighty All-god.  Water invades your lungs!
You splash underwater, not even having taken a br~
