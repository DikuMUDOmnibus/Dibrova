A Stronghold nestled among the Foothills~
A short brown grass dominates this landscape of rolling foothills.  
Lichen-covered limestone rocks jut forth from the landscape, in which
lies the entrance to a formidable stronghold.  All about, the rolling
foothills continue to span the horizon.  To the east, the tips of the
Dens mountains can be seen.

Central Foyer~
A vast foyer opens up before you.  Ancient, cold stone walls glisten
dully as the light from torches flicker weakly from their nooks.  A
rising cathedral ceiling lends to an overpower feeling of awe, it's
majestic oaken beams spanning the expanse between walls.  Old tattered
banners hang, draped from the beams overhead.

Council Chambers~
A thin layer of dust covers everything in this chamber, hinting that
it is not often that the Council convenes.  The somber stone walls
forming the boundries of the chamber offer no hint of what events may
have transpired here over the centuries.

Halls of Time~
Cold stone forms the walls in this hallway.  The air is drafty and
seems to stiffle any sound that may echo forth here.  Trailing vines
creep forth, slowly and cautiously, testing their way about for a new
foothold to climb upon.  Mosses and lichen glisten slightly as tiny
beads of moisture collect upon their living bodies.

Depository of Time~
The cold stone walls forming this vault glow with a soft light,
hinting that more than just stone protects this room.  A thin layer of
dust shows that this place is not visited frequently.

Trove of Ancients~
Cold stone walls open up to a large vaulted room.  Oaken beams rise
high in the air, bearing the shale roof above.  Mosses and lichen
adorn the cracks and spaces between each stone adding some sense of
Nature in this room that Time has forgotten.
