/cw/crVampiric Forest/c0~
You find yourself standing in the midst of a dark forest.  The air is
as still and silent as death.  The earth itself seemed drained dry of
all life by the unnatural vegetation.  A tunnel in a large tree leads
downwards.  The visage of solid stone walls is to the south, shrouded
in darkness as if near but truly distant, obscured by some dark magic.

/cw/crAngelica's Shop/c0~
This is a small, well lit chamber.  Row upon row of sturdy nirin wood
shelves line the walls, each laden with a multitude of goods both
exotic and commonplace.  The cool air is heavily perfumed with the
scent of exotic spices and rare herbs and the dark stone floor looks 
like it has been carefully swept clean.  A large cauldron full of a
golden liquid is bubbling over a fireplace in the far corner.

trees~
Shadowy trees with trunks and leaves blacker than night itself tower
above you, draining life out of its very surroundings, and your flesh
crawls as it to seems to be affected.  On the largest tree, you see a
hole shaped like a gaping maw with four sharp welcoming canine teeth.
The hole leads down into a tunnel.

/cw/crA Deep Stone Chamber/c0~
Far underground, and protected from sunlight, this dry stone chamber
have been carved out of black rock with traces of small, dark reddish
veins in them, as though dried blood had fused with the stone itself.
Totally sandless and with a high ceiling, the chamber appears to have
rich occupants, favoring dark mahogany wood for furnishings.  The
first thing noticeable is a dragon head high chair sitting among
lesser ones at the sides of a long oval table.  Richly decorated
coffins line the walls, standing upright.  A tunnel opens south from
the chamber.

chair dragon~
This chair rises from the ground as the head of a dragon, with its
jaws opened wide.  Rubies glitter as the dragon's eyes, and dark red
paint covers the chair.  The fangs of the dragon protrudes at the
edges of the chair, tinted red as though it had drawn blood quite
recently.    
~
E
table oval~
This dark mahogany table has the carved impression of a giant fanged
bat in the middle with its wings wide open.  Two rubies gleam in the
center of the table where the bat's eyes would be.  Along the edge of
the table, a shallow recess runs in a circle, joining with the bat
carving.  You suddenly realize that should blood flow onto the table,
it would circulate and fill the form of the bat.    
~
E
coffin upright~
The coffin snugly fits into a carved recess in the wall.  It is richly
inlaid with various precious gems, noticeably rubies.  Upon closer
examination, the rubies appear to be hollow, and a dark red liquid
that could only be blood fills it giving it a deep reddish look.  The
coffin is lined with soft felt, and is shaped to comfortably fit
someone who wishes to rest here.

/cw/crWhere Roots Drain Life/c0~
A dark and narrow tunnel in the black earth, the air here is dry,
unlike the usual dampness of an underground tunnel walled by earth.  
The roots of the great tree above you reaches deep into the ground
here, jutting out from the walls as though reaching and grasping for
something.  Various dead corpses litter the sides of the tunnel, each
entangled in roots, shrivelled as though the life has been sucked out
of them.  The darkness looms northward.
