/cLEntrance to the Valley/c0~
/cLArriving at the mouth of what appears to be an endless cave, looming
in perfect darkness, stepping slightly closer, it becomes apparent
that the cave is guarded by what appears to be a large two headed
dragon, surrounded by large trees on all sides which tower above./c0

/cLA Silent Cave Corner/c0~
/cLThe cave is made of a dark rock worn smooth from eons of use.  All
along the walls are lined /cybunks/cL two sometimes three high.  Each /cybunk/cL
is covered with a simple /clblack cover/cL with a bundle of /clblack velvet/cL at
the head of each for a pillow.  It seems that just enough /cwlight/cL is
naturally produced to allow for people to see there way easily to a
/cybunk/cL but not enough to make it difficult to sleep soundly.  At the far
back of the room you can see a /crshifting shape/cL that appears to stand
ready to protect any who sleep here./c0

bunk~
/cyThe bunk is made of a sturdy dark coloured wood, and has a soft
mattress made of fur and cotton.  Each bunk has a small box built into
the frame of it that seems to be just the right size to hold a weapon
and maybe a small bag./c0

/cLA cobwebbed cave corner./c0~
/cLThe chamber is made of a /clsolid black rock/cL with /cRcrimson veins/cL running
through the surfaces.  The /cRveins/cL provide a /crlight/cL that adds a morbid
/crblood tint/cL to everything inside it and barely allows one to see the
entire room.  What can be seen shows a lingering feeling of being
around for many an eon.  Is it possible the denizens of this dark and
/cbevil/cL place are older then many of the races that walk this world.  As
time passes the cave slowly and constantly shifts form, from a cave of
solid material to one of a spectral mist.  Making even the barest and
simple sense of security and fear blend as one./c0

/cLThe Storage Cave/c0~
/cLThe chamber has been dug and carved from solid rock as far back as can
be seen.  In each wall are carved large nooks holding many different
tools and equipment.  Spaced every so often along the ceiling are
large braziers burning strong and bright.  Throughout the chamber
racks, shelves and piles of all sorts of treasures, armour and weapons
can be seen.  No matter what the need these people are sure to have
whatever they could ever want here for their personal demand and use.

trove of treasures. /cy A sign indicates new arrivals are placed here./c0
