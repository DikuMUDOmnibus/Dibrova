Descent into the Lair of Jher~
As one enters the lair, the sound of howling wargs becomes louder.  
You feel a tingling in your spine, and the hair on the back of your
neck stands on end.

A Room in the Cave~
This room is lit by torches, but even brighter are the eyes of the
wargs that come to this room to feast.  These creatures are unique
because they are continuously hungry.  This is not a good place to be.
Your gaze passes from a young warg's glowing eyes to his drooling
mouth.

A Room in the Cave~
This room stinks of warg defecation.  The room is also scattered about
with bones from old kills.  One dim torch in the corner provides the
only light.  You feel very frightened.  As you look in disgust at the
bones, you can see the traces of a trapdoor underneath.

Small Treasure Room~
Before you came along this room had not seen light since Jher was only
a young man studying the ways of taming the wild.  Your eyes are
stunned by a glistening pile of gold at your feet.  Once you can pry
your eyes away from the pile of gold, you notice the snakes slithering
up and around your legs.

An Unlit Hallway~
As you journey deeper into the cave, the sounds of howling get louder.
However, the only thing you can hear is the sound of your pounding
heart.  The hallway continues west, but you also see a crack you may
be able to pass through to the south.  You hear the sound of bats
flapping overhead.

A Crack in the Wall~
For some unknown reason, you have decided to explore this crack.  The
thing you never know about caves is when you might fall into a
bottomless pit.  You hear the dripping of an underground stream, and
think about the horrible things that may be swimming or growing in it.

The Male Warg Holding Cage~
The animals in this cage, jump at you as you open the cage door.  The
door you just opened provides the fastest route to the female cage
across the room.  These disgusting wargs never get enough of two
things, food and female wargs.  You may have just provided them with
both.

These female wargs are in absolute terror of the males in the cage
across the room.  As you entered this cage, they mistake you for a
male sent in to proliferate the dirty warg race.  However once they
realize it is only you, they then try to remember when it was that
they had their last meal.

As you reach the bottom of your climb you straighten up and look
northwards.  There is a huge wood and iron door, with a round brass
handle.  There are two large warg warriors standing guard at either
side of this door.  To get by, you will either have to kill them or
sneak by and pick the lock.

Jher's Bedroom~
This is where Jher sleeps.  To avoid the chance of the wargs attacking
him in anger while he sleeps, he specially bred Knanath to protect
him.  The bedroom is dark, for Jher loves the darkness.  Above the bed
you see a hole to another tunnel.  This was to be his escape route if
was ever trapped in his room.

The Secret Room~
When you finally make it to this room, you are incredibly exhausted.
You sit down to rest on an old trunk.  As you sit, you brush aside some dust
on the trunk.  The shine from your light off the golden chest is blinding.  As
you try to open it, you realize in disappointment that it is locked.
However if you look around, you may find something hidden that will open it.
