A Well Travelled Road~
This road still continues east to west, still an extremely wide road,
made for heavy traffic.  To the east, the forest begins to close in on
either side of the road, getting more and more thick the farther east
you go.  A smaller road branches off to your north here, looking as if
it is not a very popular road, probably made by some farmer or
woodcutter who wanted easier access to his home.  West you can see the
walled city of Jareth, with majestic Lord's Keep sitting high atop the
tallest hill, flying Jareth's standard proudly.

Near a Cliff~
You still stand in the grassy field, however directly south of you the
world seems to end!  It looks as if there may be a large cliff to your
south, and from the smell of things, it must lead down to the sea.  
To the north, the field runs for some distance until reaching a
far-off forest.

A Wide Road Near the City~
Midgaard lies just northeast of you, a hop, skip, and jump away.  To
the south is a long, wide road which is filled with traffic at all
ours of the day and night, it being the main route from Midgaard to
Jareth, the Free City.

Bend in the Road~
A large forest looms directly west of you, the cheerful sounds of
animals playing and branches creaking coming from its interior.  To
the east is the way into Midgaard, a short span of wide road that runs
right up to the city's west gate.

The trail is so faint now that you can barely see it.  You almost have

trees and such, so faint is the trail.

The trail leads east into a huge maze made of shrubbery easily 10 feet
high.  It runs north and south of the path you stand on as far as your
eyes can see in either direction.  Looks like a fellow could get lost
in there pretty easily.

Riding Lessons~
Harah gives lessons here for a small fee, what he calls a mandatory

what it is - a fee.    

To train your riding ability further, just type PRAC RIDE.

Wonder of wonders!  You feel as if you could see the whole world from
where you currently stand.  Just east of you, sitting proudly on a
large rock, almost a plateau, is the huge seaport town of McGintey
Cove.  The twin bridges which lead from the edge of the cliff to the
city gate are the only entrance or exit from the town.  The trail wlso
runs west far into the distance, skirting the southern edge of a huge
field, which seems t go on forever.

Ranger Reception~
You stand in a rugged but peaceful room devoted mostly to the Mother,
Nature.  All furniture in the room has not been worked in any way, but
allowed to keep it's natural shape.  Obviously someone(s) went to
great lengths to find these pieces which would allow comfort and rest
without marring them in any way.  You give a start as you realize that
many of the seats in this room are already taken by people who blend
so well into the seats as almost seem invisible.  Many seem to be in
meditation, while others simply relax, enjoying herbal drinks offered
by others of the same kind.  The entrance to the main Ranger Guild
Hall lies south through an archway which shimmers with a light not
unlike that of a warm spring day.  North is the exit to Floris Ave.

This is a fairly nondescript room with wood walls and no true

its hard to tell because he keeps the lights fairly dim.    

You can also STABLE you're mounts here, for use at a later date.

Or you can REDEEM stable tokens to get your mount back.

The feeble old man who pokes at his small fire with a stick rests upon
his haunches before the fire, staring into the flames intently.  The
man's true name has long been forgotten, he is now known only as the
Netherman - the One who has the power to send anyone to the Nether
with a single spoken word.  Do not attempt to make the journey to the
Nether unless you have brought a friend and do not attempt it even
with a friend unless the both of you are an awesome power within the
world.
