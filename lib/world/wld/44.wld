The Plains of Malathar~
You have emerged from the dark forest on the plains of the Elven Duchy
of Malathar, ruled by the good Duke Stalatharata, under the guidance
and watchful presence of his God and Mentor, the Elven Immortal
Yaegar.  Tall spires rise in the distance, emerging from the
magnificent Elven city of Malathar, to which the path you are upon
leads.  There is a small, hand-lettered sign near the path...

The Road to Malathar~
You are moving along a broad, well-formed path that is bordered by
neatly- groomed trees and hedges.  To the north you can hear what
sounds like a horse braying, while to the east the city of Malathar
looms larger.

You feel a sudden sense of peace and serenity wash over you as you
enter this gentle wooded glade.  Here the sound of braying is louder,
and you fancy you can smell the odour of equine beasts.  The aura of
the surroundings make you feel like doing nothing more that lying down
and resting for a LONG time...

The Unicorn Glade~
You have entered the sanctum of the Unicorns of of Malathar, close
friends and allies of the Elves of Malathar.  However, despite their
benevolent nature, the Unicorns dislike intruders, especially armed
and aggressive ones, and will not hesitate to use extreme force to
evict these intruders.  In addition, to protect these creatures, the
Elven sorceror Tuo has placed powerful enchantments on this place that
prevent magical attacks on the unicorns.

You have progressed further along the road to the Elven capital, past
several farmhouses and various creatures of the wild that stop to
stare inquisitively at you as you pass.  The gates of the city are now
visible, as are the guards stationed near them, their colorful
rainments dazzling you even from this distance.  In the near distance
there appears to be a monument of some sort.

A Monument to the Elven Lords~
At this point on the road the Nobles of Malathar have had a huge
marble monument erected, dedicated to the many Elven Lords who died
during the ferocious Goblin Wars that devastated most of the Elven
Nations.  The statue shows a band of Elves courageously defending an
unarmed woman and her child from a band of hideous Goblins, and is
quite brilliantly fashioned.  There is an inscription at the base of
the statue.

A Prominent Farmhouse~
As you approach the gates of the city, you pass by a prominent
farmhouse, far more distinguished and well-kept than its neighbours.
A pungent herbal aroma wafts on the wind to your nose, and your eyes
water involuntarily.  There is a small sign in one window.

find it to be rather pleasant.  Mithara quickly informs you that the
substance is tobacco, and that she specializes in it.  She also has a
wide range of other substances, including potions, herbs and healing
salves.

You have finally reached the Gates of Malathar, huge oaken portals
banded with bronze.  Guards patrol smartly both inside and outside the
gate, constantly on guard for troublemakers or looters.  However, the
City of Malathar is always open to peaceful travellers, and it has not
been necessary to close the City Gates for six decades.  There is a
sign posted on one of the gates.

oil atop the walls ready to pour upon any foes that seek to enter by
this route.

Scout Station~
It is here that the young Elves who wish to become Elite Scouts live
and learn.  They are rarely here during most of the year, often out
hunting, tracking or fighting Goblin raiders.  The few that are here
are those that were not fit or worthy enough to take to the field this
season.

co-ordinate their efforts to keep the peace in the streets of
Malathar, handling mostly cases of petty crime (the Elite Guard handle
serious problems).  They frown on civilians entering their premises,
but will tolerate your presence for they will recognize you as a mere
ignorant foreigner who probably doesn't speak enough Elvish to
understand when they're being told to LEAVE.

brazier in the center of rooms holds some burning herbs, which fill
the room with an acrid smoke.  An elderly elf is busy fiddling with a
rather strange contraption upon which he places black plastic discs
from which a rather odd sound emerges, along with much scratching and
hissing.  He has quite a collection of these disks, which are packaged
in luridly-colored paper envelopes, replete with pictures of rather
weedy-looking, long-haired, pale-skinned humans (?  ).

To the north are the various shops and business premises of the

The Stables~
You are walking through an open area littered with hay and the
occasional pile of steaming turds.  Stablehads rush about, cleaning up
these filthy messes.

This room is scarcely different form the other stable rooms, save that
it contains a table and a chair for the stablemaster, a burly Half-Elf
with tattoos and a tan.

The Captain's Quarters~
You have entered a well-furnished office which serves as the reception
area for the Captain of the Guard.  He will chat with you here about
your concerns and try to give you advice, but will always remain on
guard.  He boasts to you of the fact that his office is a magical
field, and that dimensional gateways occasionally appear here.  
Sounds like crap but you never know...

Sun Room~
You have entered the Palace's Sun Room, famous for his huge
crystalline windows specially crafted to capture and magnify the rays
of the sun so that the room is brilliantly lit at all hours of the
day.  A few easychairs and cushions have been scattered across the
floor here, and you see a couple of Elven Nobles languidly relaxing in
the warmth of the sun, sipping on fine Elven wines.

Guards mingle about the doorway, casting the occasional suspicious
glance in your direction.  Massive stone statues of past Elven lords
tower above you on all sides.

The Moon Room~
This room appears to be identical to the Sun Room, save that the
windows in here are cunningly designed to capture and reflet moonlight
so that even on the darkest nights there is illumination.  Nobles
lounge around here, idly singing old tunes or playing simple games of
chance.

you can see the stone colossus of the Duke.  Garlands of flowers have
been arranged about the South Door, in honor of some half-forgotten
festival.

The Throne Room~
It is here that the Duke and his wife receive their subjects, seated
upon huge platinum thrones flanked by their Elite Guards.  
Occasionally Tuo the Arch Mage or Lallinthenera the High Priest will
attend, though both dislike such officious business.  Your footsteps
echo about this pillared hall as you tread slowly upon the marble
floor.  You can feel several pairs of eyes on you as you travel, and
suddenly find yourself eager to be gone from the room as soon as
possible.

street, past the various shops and places of business, towards the
Gates of Malathar.  People stop and stare at you with open curiosity,
and you quickly become aware of your relatively scruffy appearance.

The Water Room~
The second you enter this room you begin to panic, as you suddenly
think you are far underwater!  But you quickly compose yourself
(trying to ignore the amused stares cast in your direction), and
realize that the room you are in is in fact formed of sheets of glass
behind which flows sea water complete with several species of marine
life.  The effect is unnerving, but quite beautiful.  You have to
concentrate hard to cross the room, and can't help but imagine you are
truly walking on water...

and the Tower of the Archmage.  Several scouts mill about, their
Cooshee pets left momentarily unattended, and you suddenly feel very
much an alien in this place.

ACK!  You're Falling!  Wait...  No you aren't.  Unbelieveable as it
is, the entire room has been fashioned so as to appear to be open sky,
with no walls, floors or celings.  People wander about, quite unfazed
by the effect, and you feel a little foolish as you clamber to your
feet and attempt to get your bearings.

The Central Shelving Area~
You are in the Central Shelving Area, from which the librarians take
the many books being constantly borrowed, returned, bought and sold.
You are overawed by the sheer volume of books in this place, and gasp
as you realize that the shevles are at least seventy feet high and
extend as far as you can see...

You are in the South Wing, where recent acquisitions (i.  E, less than
500 years old) are stored.  The pace down here is so frenetic, no one
even notices your presence, and you feel certain that you could pocket
a couple of tomes or librams and no-one would know...

practically deserted.  This is where out-of-date or obsolete texts are
held, and you see little that seems interesting.  You are not
surprised no-one wants any books from this area.

the lack of space allowed for the Guild, but just the same, the
Guildmaster here seems perfectly content, poring over old tomes.

that slopes down from here...  Alternatively, you could just return to
the ground floor...

You have reached B2, the dusty storage sub-level mentioned on the
directory on the ground floor.  It looks as if no-one has been down
here for centuries.  There seems to be little of interest here.  
However, you fancy that you can hear snoring coming from somewhere...

Uh-Oh....  You found out what was snoring...  It is a DRAGON...  A
HUGE DRAGON, coiled up in the massive cavern you just entered, its
sinuous tail wrapped about a massive treasure chest.  The Dragon must
be about eighty or ninety feet long, you estimate, at least twice the
length of any you've fought before, and to top it off he is a Platinum
Dragon, who are amongst the most powerful of all Wyrmkin.  Amazed that
the Dragon hasn't reacted to your presence yet, you pause and wonder
what to do...
