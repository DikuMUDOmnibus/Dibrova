Dune Crest~
You walk your sand ridden boots up the base of a large sand dune,
wondering when this sand will end.  You reach the crest of the dune,
peering out into the haze of dry air searching for a shred of change.

Dune, indeed.  More aptly put, this is a mountain made of very fine
sand.  You are currently at one of the highest points of the dune,
able to see for quite some distance in all directions.  It is less
than a shock to see that sand lies for quite some ways every way that
you turn.

You stand at the highest point of the dune, the sand underfoot
extremely hard compared to most of the rest of the way you had to
travel on your way up.  It almost feels as if there might be rock
under the sand from the way your footing has reached such solidity.

creatures and Gods of olden times.

Darkened Rock Chimney~
It is hard to call this shaft of open darkness anything but a chimney.
The rock walls are blackened and rough, forming a mostly circular
radius around you.  The air is stagnant and unmoving, the way down
blocked by a grating which looks to have a lock upon it.  A niche in
the east side of the wall holds the unknown; it is completely dark.  
A small hand hold lies upon the west wall.

Above you lies the dark air of the Chimney, the way back to the mortal
world, ahead of you - to the east - lies the way into a place so
surreal, so beyond the limits of mortal comprehension, that it takes a
moment or two for the sight of what lies ahead to sink in.  A wide,
vaulted chamber heads east for a short span, opening into a huge
chamber all finished in hues of gold and light colored rock.  A pool
of translucent water lies on the south side of the chamber, its waters
lapping gently at floor level.

This long, vaulted chamber - almost churchlike - is walled in on the
north side by huge columns of stone all engraved and chiseled in
majestic patterns.  The columns run the entire length from floor to
ceiling, massive entities that dominate your field of vision.  On the
south side of the room lies a pool of water, its color that of which
you have never seen the like: a glowing, transparent sort of
luminescent color.  To the east the chamer opens into an enormous
temple, the size and height indescernible from here.

the temple is one massive room, flanked on the north and south sides
by sprawling sets of steps which run for hundreds of feet before
reaching their apex.  A stream runs by on the south side of the
chamber you currently stand in, the water running in an easterly
direction, its source the pool of water which could be entered onto
from the room to the west, the stream itself running east under the
floor of the temple.

be felt tugging at your clothing even here.  You would almost swear
that through the swirls of air currents, you see a figure all dressed
in white, hovering there in the air.

The Northern Heights of the Temple~
You now stand at the topmost section of the steps, the view of the
temple now complete and amazing in its own right.  Far across the span
of open air, past the temple and up the southern steps you can see the
outline of two enormous thrones, both of them facing your direction.
To the north, a hall leads deep into the heart of this subterreanian
complex.

Throne Room~
You stand at the base of one of the two thrones, the other just to
west.  The size of both these thrones is a wonderment - truly Gods
must use these as their perch.  Your shoulder comes up to the base of
the first cushion where one might sit upon these thrones, standing on
tip-toe you can barely get a glance at the seating.  The Temple lies
far below, a beautiful sight from this height.

The Halls of Divinity~
This wide chamber leads north and south into the depths of rock that
you explore.  Open entryways lead into rooms along the west side of
the hall, light emanating from most of those rooms.  Along the east
wall are engraved pictures of Gods and many of their battles,
conquests, loves and losses.  At the north end of this hall, a
terrible darkness blankets your field of vision.  Overwhelming dread
flows from that direction.  Tread lightly.
