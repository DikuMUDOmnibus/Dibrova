woods to your west, the breeze gently blowing through the treetops,
and the plains stretching out to the north, you could almost believe
that the land is full of nothing but goodness and purity.  Until you
hear a far-off cry from somewhere in the city of, "STOP!  THIEF!".
Ah, well...  You may continue to the north or south.

The Cobbler's Shop~
You have entered a very small shop belonging to the cobbler.  He sits
at a table sewing a new pair of shoes.  He seems to have quite a
collection of shoes on the shelves and you wonder in he has made them
all by hand.

the west windows.  The bartender is the largest man you have ever laid
eyes on.  He wears a bearskin coat and has a grizzly face.

is the Lazy Elk Inn, a small, tidy inn with a good reputation in this
town as being a good place to rest the night.  To the east is the
teleporter's shop, where one may purchase instant travel to other
realms of Dibrova.

not taken the profits they make to create a gaudily decorated building
for all to envy and admire, rather they have given better interest
rates and helped to support the community with the funds that are in
excess of the small salaries the employees take.  The people of
Silverthorne are very proud of their bank and its proprieter.

Abernathy's General Store~
This little hole in the wall general store has been a functioning part
of Silverthorne since before it was known as Silverthorne.  Old
Abernathy started tending shop back when he realized that his chances
of being a successful farmer were slim and none (due to a bad back),
so he decided that - instead of leaving all the fine folk of the
village - he would open a general store to help serve all his friends
that much the better.  And he stills tends shop to this day.

its people.  The once white washed walls have faded into a dingy
tan-brown color, the guerney looks as if Abel might use it for his bed
when he's on the outs with the wife.  Ah well, if the locals can deal

Silverthorne.  It is almost beyond belief that all eight guilds could
function so close to each other, due to their natural tendency toward
competition and in some cases, dislike.  The City Square lies just
north of here.  To the east is the Mage's Guild, to the west the
Paladin Guild.
