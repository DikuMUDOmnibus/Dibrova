An exploding Supernova~
Brilliant and dazzling lights erupt and twinkle out in a blink of an

blasts through.  The second passing sonic boom renders apart whole
planets and other celestial bodies into chunks of debris.  Finally, a
wave of debris sweeps through, tearing everything away into oblivion.
When all is done, nothing remains.

soon lose much of it's weight and begin to deteriorate and fade away.

heavens in blissful silence.

Floating chunks of rock, of all sizes, drift about aimlessly in a
strip of gravitational force.  Some rocks, large as a small moon, plow
their way through the cluster of smaller rocks with ease.  The belt
stretches for as long as the eye can see, yet it's width is narrow.

Wellspring of Uranus~
A spring, bubbling free-flowing blood, lies in the center of the room.
The blood is a bright crimson color, red as if freshly cut.  From
here, the blood flows out in all directions, following the grooves in
the ground.  The blood even goes upwards, powered by some unknown
magical force.

is the prision of the Hecatoncheires, powerful beings of terrible
might and destruction.  A mist envelopes the room, obscuring
everything.  Sounds of rumbling, whooshing air, and thunder echo from
the depths of the mist.

Free-flowing River of Blood~
A vast ocean of blood sprawls out for as far as the eye can see.  The
sky is black and nary a sound can be heard save for the gentle lapping
of waves.  The currents flow southerly, suggesting that a source of
all this blood might lie somewhere north.

Abode of Shame and Failure~
All those who have been unsuccessful at completing the quest end up
here.  This is, by no means the end, just a harsh reminder of what one
must achieve to be one of the fabled Titans in Dibrova.  Keep in mind
what you have just experienced and remember them, for you can use them
as you do the quest again in the near future.  Good luck!

Descent to Tartarus~
A vast chasm, known as Tartarus opens here.  Pitch-black darkness fill
the empty recesses and frost lightly coat them.  Somehow, some magical
force draws everything downward.  To resist this power is pointless
and futile!

The Bowels of Tartarus~
The very bottom of the chasm contains nothing, save for darkness and a
being who's essence can be felt here.  To be casted down here is the
worse punishment one could ever receive, mortal or immortal, for there
is no escape from here.

At the Beginning~
Nothing lies here in this void, not even light.  This is the very
beginning of time, nothing has come into existence yet.  Soon, over
the eons, the birth of the Cosmos will take place.
