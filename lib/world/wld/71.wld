Outside the Wayhouse~
You are outside a large, two-story building which proports to be
'Werith's Wayhouse' on a brightly lettered sign out front.  You hear
laughing and revelry from inside -- sounds like a lively place.  The
main doors are directly south of you, and small paths lead east and
west around the building.  Eastward is another smaller building;
obviously a stable.  Northward is the main road, providing all the
traffic and customers for this establishment.

Near a Large Building~
You are north-west of the Wayhouse.  This section of the path seems
less used, possibly because there's nothing really over here.  The
trees crowd in towards the clearing, making the general area seem
rather eerie somehow.  The voices coming from inside are clearly
audible, and by listening hard you can almost make out the words.  
The path around the building continues to the west and south.

Near a Large Building~
You are standing on the path that runs around the Wayhouse to the
west.  A window spills light onto the trees that block out all
available light overhead.  You hear general merryment and alcoholism
from inside, and wonder if being inside would be more fun than walking
around outside...

Near a Large Building~
You are south-west of the main structure of the Wayhouse.  A lone rain
barrel catches run-off from the roof eaves by the corner of the
building, and you spy a small white fence cordoning off an herb garden
nearby.  The path around the building leads to the north and east.

Outside the Wayhouse~
You are standing just south of Werith's Wayhouse, right where the
kitchen entrance is.  A well trodden path leads east, towards a small
shack that is unmistakeably an outhouse.  You hear the unmistakeable
sound of clanging pots and pans from the inside, the warning of an
upcoming meal.  The path around the building here runs east, and west.

The Wayhouse is just north-west of you here, and you are right by the
facility's outhouse to the south.  The wooden planks of the stable
form an alley to the north, with the path leading right in-between.  
Westwards is the kitchen entrance to the Wayhouse, kept wide open to
let the heat inside escape.

breaks off to the south, between the two buildings, towards what
appears to be an outhouse.

The stable of the Wayhouse is just south of you, its wooden doors
spread open and inviting.  Inside you can hear the snorting of horses,
and the occasional hoof scraping against the ground.  The path leads
to the west, towards the Wayhouse.

You are standing inside the dusty confines of the stable.  Stalls line
the aisle, some with horses, some empty.  A pail filled with water and
a stack of grain are heaped up against the interior wall, dimly
illuminated by a lantern hanging from a rafter.  Seems rather quiet in
here...

The bar runs south here all along the western wall.  A few smaller
tables here are set up with various board games, ready to play.  
There's also a shelf along the wall, lined with a few popular books;
light reading all of them.  The patrons here seem to be a bit quieter
than the rowdy bunch in the rest of the building.

Main Room~
A window here offers a view outside, where it doesn't seem near as
social as it is inside.  Tables filled with laughing customers eat and
drink and generally be merry, not caring what the weather is like, and
probably not even knowing.  There's a general sense of joy in the
room; the joy of still being alive in such a dangerous world as this
one.  For a moment, you feel like joining them...

Main Room~
You stand just inside the Main Room of Werith's Wayhouse.  The whole
place stretches out all around you, a conglomeration of people, food,
and alcohol.  The sheer chatter and roar of conversation makes your
ears hurt a little, and then you suddenly notice you're smiling.  
Yes, this place might do for awhile...

The giant fireplace here sends a great amount of heat throughout the
room.  The sheer massiveness of the stone edifice and the literal
bonfire inside makes you give the area a clear way.  A few of the
older and less human residents of the inn seem to be enjoying these
tables, however.

Several dart boards line the wall to the south, and darts are

coming up and down the stairs to the east carefully walk by the wall
to avoid being pin-cushioned involuntarily, and you think it would be
a good idea to do the same.

The tables seem to thin out around here, to give room for the traffic
going in and out of the kitchen through the archway to the south.  
Waiters and waitresses march in and out with empty plates and
sumptuous platters, hardly stopping to breathe in their business.  
You hear the distant clank of a pot banging against something -- the
chefs are busy too it seems.  Your stomach growls...  Are you hungry
at all?

This seems to be a central part of the room, where many people
congregate to talk or sing or dance or whatever they feel like at that
exact moment.  The people seem just on the edge of being completely
carried away at every moment, and you wonder if it would be beneath
your dignity to join them.

The wooden bar runs along the length of the western wall, just in
front of the many shelves of different colored alcohol in different
shaped bottles.  You espy drunkards and waitresses, adventurers and
farmers althroughout the building from this vantage point, and guess
that this establishment is turning a pretty penny in profits.  Nice.

The bar continues along the length of the western wall.  An empty
bottle with some spare coppers in it lies on top of its polished
surface; tip collection evidently.  The tables nearby seem mostly
filled with people and food, the bar appears at times to be either
packed, or merely elbow-to- elbow.  A lantern hanging from a rafter
overhead casts shadows among the beerstains on the floor and gives the
complexion of everyone around a sort of glow.  You feel...  
Comfortable here.

In the clutter of the main room of the Wayhouse, is a path leading out
from the kitchen to the east.  A wide archway allows admittance to the
back room, from which you hear the distant clank of a pan hitting
another.  There aren't very many tables here, due to the amount of
traffic coming in and out.

This is the main entranceway of the kitchen.  Two archways serve as an
entry and exit point from the main room of the wayhouse, one north,
one west.  The kitchen is a room roughly thirty feet by thirty feet,
extending from the south and east from here.  You see many pots on the
stove bubbling away and hear the whistle of a kettle somewhere off to
the left...  Business must be good.

Kitchen~
You are standing in a more quiet area of the kitchen, where various
supplies of flour, grain and meats are kept.  The kitchen extends
south and west from here; that's where the main clutter seems to be.
A steady thump-thump-thump from the north wall reminds you that the
main room is where are the fun and action seems to be...

Kitchen~
The south-eastern section of the kitchen here is a veritable whirlwind
of activity!  The entire area is comprised of cooking surfaces and
ovens; enough to keep a massive amount of food ready at any one time.
The aisles are large, allowing room for frantic chefs and waiters to
hurtle through the kitchen with only a small amount of collisions.  
Seems hectic, yet efficient.  The rest of the kitchen is to the north
and west from here.

This is the back entranceway to the kitchen, where the door is kept
seasonally open to allow the hot air to escape.  Some trash is piled
up near the door, waiting to be taken out.  The main area of the
kitchen extends to the north and east from here, a hodge-podge of
business and insanity in motion.  Looking at the general cleanliness,
however, you think this would be a good place to eat.

This is a quiet, darkened corner -- it appears someone has put out the
lantern here on purpose.  You feel a chill, probably due to your
distance from the fire, and rub your arms absently.  There's a table
set near the corner, a single chair behind it in the shadowy of
shadows.  You get the cliche'd feeling someone in robes should be
sitting there.

southern part of the wayhouse, but the whole place still has that
'mostly filled' air to it.  The dull roar of conversation and the warm
air from the fire makes you feel at home somehow, makes you want to
have a seat.

up, glinting off the polished handrail.  An arch to the east opens up
into the main room...  Where the noise informs you that the revelry
hasn't stopped yet.

exterior walls.  A light at the top of the stairs throws illumination
down the hall.

Um.  Whew!  It's definitely an outhouse...  Doesn't smell too good at
all.  There's a wooden plank with a few 'convenient' holes cut in it
for service, and several curtains hung up for privacy.  A bowl with a
large cake of soap next to it serve as sanitary measures.  Otherwise,
there's not too much here that you take an interest in...
