Wide White Stone Road~
This opulent boulevard belies the undertone of latent danger and
promiscuity that is the trademark of this guild area.  Dominating most
of your vision is the guild house, a huge gleamingly clean white manor
house that lies at the east end of the street, its pillared front
promising wealth and fame to all those who join.  A well-tended park
lies on the north side of the road.  On the south side is a well-kept
tavern, the sounds of music drifting out fom the inside.

Wide White Stone Road~
This polished white road is a wonder - how could any organization keep
a road which peoples' dirty feet and horses' nasty hooves stomp and
tromp all over every day clean?  On the south side of the road is a
clean, pseudo-rustic looking tavern with music coming from within.  
The dominating presence of this area is the huge white manor house
that is the guild house to the Bard's Guild.  It lies at the east end
of the street.

The Lonesome Troubadour~
The people in this inn seem not only friendly and expansive, but clean
and respectable.  The single bard up on stage who plays a wonderful
song on his flute has to be, hands down, the best flutist you ever
have had the occasion to hear.  The barman smiles broadly in your
direction, welcoming you to Dun Pith and the Lonesome Troubadour.

The road is so wide, so expansive in the way that it leads toward the
guild house like a white carpet of honor.  To the south is the
symphony, the building itself a work of art with it fluted pillar
front and its wide stone steps leading up to the entrance.

Wide White Stone Road~
You stand before the Grand Entrance to the guild house for the bards.
The majesty and awe which is naturally associated with this profession
is naturally inferred upon anyone who stands before the hallowed halls
of this place - the mother-house of the guild.  State Road runs north
and south from the guild, the walkways lined in beautiful flowers of
all colors.

The Symphony~
The interior to this place is perpetually dark, the candelabra along
the walls which run on the outside of the seating area only lit when
the opera is about to begin or end.  The stage is a dark mystery, the
folds of the curtain obscuring most of what might lie upon the stage.

Peaceful Park~
The west side of this park is the back stone wall of Olis' Country
Market, making the Metier Street on the other side of the building
seem almost non-existant.  A small pond holds what appear to be tiny
golden fish which swim about happily.  Butterflies play about the many
wild flowers which grow in abundance.  This would certainly be a prime
spot to rest.

Opera House~
This was indeed once a house, albeit an extremely large one.  The
entire front-facing facade of the building was revamped, as was this
interior, all but the main support beams for the place gutted and
removed.  A wide stage lies on the far west side of the place, past
many rows of seats.  All of the walls have been reworked, rounded near
the ceilings to help to amplify the sound of the singers' voice.

neatly mortared together without a single one missing or askew.  
State Road makes a crossing with another just north of here and runs
in front of the guild house to the south.

The din and general commotion which is so pervasive to the north in
the main section of town is very dimished on this small nook of a road
which just barely enters into the property owned by the bards guild.
Things are distinctly different here - the sides of the road lined in
colorful flowers, the street itself well-kept and clean.

Finelyn's House of Music~
Finelyn started his days as a street musician, a man with some fair
talent at playing various instruments.  Upon reaching the requisite
age for joining the bard's guild, he did so, only to find that he was
not the maestro that he hoped he was.  He left the guild after two
years of disappointing study and went to work for a local cobbler,
where he found that his talent with wood far surpassed he talent at
making music.  He first lyre, made when he was but seventeen years of
age, is still used by the Guild Master in the guild house, a fine
honor for Finelyn and testament that his instruments are the finest in
the land.

Small Back Street~
It is amazing how much more quiet it can get taking a step from one
street to another.  You now stands within the confines of the bard
area of town, a place where the appearance of calm and dignity is all
that matters.  It is, of course, all a sham - but a well-played sham
played by the masters of deception and playing, the bards.  On the
north and south sides of the street are beautiful gardens, well-kept
and open to the public.  To the east, the street heads further into
the bard area, bordered by trees which are kept trimmed and businesses
which are maintained immaculate.

Iron-Fenced Park~
This park is all that is left of the 'natural' splendor that was here
before Dun Pith grew to the monster that it is today - or at least
that is what the bard's guild claims.  The shrubbery that grows here
is all of native origin, the flowers all claim the same decendancy.  
A black iron fence with spiked rails seperates this tranquil place
from the main section of town, the main square visible through the
fence to the northwest.

clothing shop, the wares of which are expensive even to the more
affluent memebers of the society of Dun Pith.

Stage Apparel~
The finest and probably oddest clothing in the land can be found right
here in Stage Apparel, Inc.  The owner of the place had always hoped
that his name and clothing line could go franchise, however the demand
for the theatre and all that goes along with it has always centered
around the Dun Pith area, never really spreading out in force to other
cities

season after season, however a committee is still called to session to

the gardens of the bard's guild are kept in such splendor and
magnificence as to be considered almost surreal.  Almost all bards who
study under the tutelage of the guild come to these gardens to try and
find their muse, to meditate upon life's higher meanings.  To all
directions except north are the gardens, to the north is State Road
and the way to the guild.

The name of this enormous hall is known throughout the bardic circles

entertain in this grand hall, it is generally felt that the future of
that one is secure as a bard.  This is also the main entry room of the
guild, made so large and opulent on purpose to discourage any who
might come to study and not give their full effort.

Named for not only the fact that this room is as beautific and grand

attitude which must be conveyed by all bards in the world.  Much of
what a bard is regarded by is through their entrance, their opening
walk to the stage or forefront, when every one of their audince's eyes
are upon them.  Ah, the Grand Entrance.  The moment for every bard.

Plush Hallway~

freshly painted and free of stain or blemish.  On the eastern wall is
a door from which delicious smells waft.  It is presumed that the
kitchen lay behind that door.

Dining Hall~
This is more of a worked-over cafeteria, a large room with many round
tables scattered throughout.  The kitchen lies to the south, behind a
buffet-style table where food is always laid out for those students
who go hungry.  Doors to the hallway lie to the east, west and south.

Kitchen~
There is always a constant din, a commotion which rivals that of a
first recital, in this room.  The cooks labor all day long and many
times into the night to provide food to the students and faculty of
the place, all of which eat at different hours.  The door on the north
side opens into the dining hall, the doors on the east and west sides
access the main hallway.

Administration~
Any would-be student must first meet the criteria of the
administration at the guild.  The administration decides on talent,
class placement, courses of study and which teachers to place the
musician(s) with.  This, truly, is the place where the guild house's
wheels are kept oiled and smooth.

Second-Story Hallway~
The hallway on this level is just as plush and comfortable as the one
below, however it is a bit more worn, as if more feet tread upon it on
a regular basis.  To the east is more of the hallway, the same to the
south.  On the west wall is a door leading to a private teacher's room
where a member of the staff is always on hand to keep the peace and
help the students of the guild.

- the place from which the Maestro reigns this guild.  It is more an
office than a suite, a place where the Maestro can take care of the
daily business of running the guild.  Only a few students have
actually seen the interior of that room, and then only those who
possess great talent.

into the private quarters of one of the teachers, a room which is
shared by all of the teachers throughout the day, making sure that at
least two staff members are on hand at all times to keep fights and
trouble to a minimum.

matching cots, two of which are bunk beds.  The beds lie along the
north and south walls with a large desk seperating them on the east
wall.  Trunks lie at the foot of both sets of beds, presumably
containing the personal articles of the students which sleep in this

Maestro's Suite~
It is a place of the highest honor within the Bards Guild to become
the Maestro at the guild house here in Dun Pith.  Along with the title
inferred, all amenities including this opulent office are also endowed
to the wearer of that title.  This is very much a working office,
however lavish the furnishings might be.  The desk is enormous and
worked with carvings depicting the Gods of music and art as they
frolic about.  The only exit from this room lies to the north through
a massive oaken door.

which the instructor works.

Solo~
This small room is where the students of the guild usually make it or
break it.  Every entertainer gets put on the spot at one time or
another to perform without the aid of any backup or accompaniment.  
The very last test for every student who wishes to graduate to the
world of dancing, singing, music and love is given in this very room.

Symphony~
This is probably the largest of all the rooms on the upper level,
aside from the Maestro's Suite.  Rows of chairs make neat rows upon a
bleacher setup, wooden music stands set before each chair.  Music is
fine when played by a virtuoso, however not every virtuoso can perform
well with a group.  This is the place where those who fall short are
found to be what they are.
