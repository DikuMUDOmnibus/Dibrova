You are standing in the emperor's private office.  The room is richly
furnished with the finest of the loot brought back from conquests of
far away lands.  There is a massive, intricately carved desk here,
upon which are important documents, decrees and other paperwork
involved in running the empire.  On the far wall, there is a marble
bookcase that is well stocked with the works of Homer, Plato, Socrates
and other wise men.  Further, it seems that the current emperor likes
flowers as there are many potted and cut specimens throughout the
room.  There is a french door leading to the waiting room and a wooden

You are standing in the mage's shop.  Magical ointments, charms and

dense neon blue fog hugging the floor here, making it impossible to
see below your knees.  You suddenly hear muttering coming from the
back room, possibly from ....  
KKKKKAAAAAAAABBBBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!
You are deafened by the noise from a tremendous explosion and the
concussion from the blast staggers you!  The shopkeeper seems to pay
no heed to this.  The door to the back room opens and an older man,
wearing a pointed hat, whose face is smudged with soot, sticks his
head out.  "Is everyone alright?  Sorry about that.  I was testing a
new mage's spell.  I'll try to give advance notice next time," he
