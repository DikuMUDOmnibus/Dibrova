Entrance to the Lair~
Before you is a large cast iron gate, and beyond lies a dimly lit
hallway leading into the lair of Graghtok.  The wind seems to whistle
out a warning to you to not proceed any further.  A wretched smell of
decaying flesh fills your nostrils.  As you think of what lies inside
this unholy place you hear a shriek of a hideous nature from behind.
Looking back you see only the trail from which you have travelled.  
Then the shriek is heard again, this time from inside the lair,
followed by a death cry.  There are words engraved on a metal plate on
the gate.

A Long Hallway~
The stagnant air inside this hallway provides only enough oxygen for a
dim light from the torches adorning the walls.  The only sounds heard
are your footsteps and your steady heartbeat.  Scattered throughout
the hallway are various bones from the previous adventurers.  North
takes you deeper into the lair, and south leads to the outside.

A Long Hallway~
The hallway seems to end abruptly here.  Leaving you facing a large
stone wall with an out of place torch.  Except for a painting of a
creature of an unfamiliar race the wall is barren.  The light from the
south has seemed to die out leaving nothing but blackness.  Of course
there must be a way to go further, maybe this is a premonition warning
you not to look?  South takes you back through the hallway.

Base of Stairs~
You are in a small room with barely enough space to walk through.  In

a small hole in the ceiling.  The floor is covered with a crimson
liquid which appears to be dripping down from a large crack in the
east wall.  Other then that this room is completely empty.

appear to be of an ancient wood no longer around.  There is a red
light coming from the top of the stairs, and a black abyss below.

As you open the way to this room you are drenched with a flow of
blood.  After clearing your eyes you see nothing but red, and a large
creature staring at you from the far corner.  His eyes glow red and
his grin is foul.  It quickly becomes apperant that you have disturbed
his bath as he attacks!

Top of the Stairs~
Stepping into this room you are blessed with a blast of fresh air
coming from a barred hole high above.  The little creatures here don't
appear to notice you, and go about their business.  In the center of
this enourmous room is a large fountain, but you don't think you
should drink from it because of the dark red liquid it provides.  
There are exits in all the cardinal directions and down.  However, the
you don't see the little monks using the exits to the east and west.

Dark Hallway~
Walking into this hallway you start hearing sounds of torture.  
Screams and cries of pain.  The monks surrounding you are steadfast in
their ways and do not seem to notice you or each other.  At the end of
this torchless hallway is a bright light.  For some unknown reason you
feel drawn to it.  The walls seem to get narrow as you proceed.  
South takes you back to the fountain, and north is still unknown.

Graghtok's Pit~
Once inside this ghastly room you can see a large candelabra hanging
from the ceiling, lighting the room with a brilliant yellow.  A large
podium is on the north wall where an important looking monks of
Graghtok sits.  In the center of this room appears to be a bottomless
pit in which the mindless monks are falling into without hesitation.
You can hear the sound of death coming from below.  Suddenly, you feel
drawn toward the pit, and almost let the feeling overwhelm you before
stapping out of it.  You had better get out of here fast.

In the Pit~
After a plunge of about fifty hands you find yourself in a blood
stained room of death.  Looking around you see massives hounds with
teeth like razors tearing the monks to shreds, and piling the remains
in a corner.  You see no way back out of this pit, and realize that
even if you could handle the hounds you will not be able to climb back
out.  It would appear hopeless.

A Pond~
In the middle of this room is a majestic looking pond with sparkling
blue water.  The water is clear and placid.  The calm atmosphere is
welcome, and invites you to rest and heal your wounds.  In the middle
of this pond, however, is a figure holding a key.  The figure doesn't
move, and appears lost within itself.  The walls are all lined with
beautiful jewels reflecting your light to one center point, which lies
on the key in the figures grasp.

Dark Hallway~
In this hallway there are no torches, and even with your light it is
hard to what lies ahead.  A steady flow of mindless monks is coming
from the south, each one identical to the others.  Your heart seems to
beat in heavy throbs as you feel the evil to the south.  You get the
feeling you should be going north, but a light draws your attention to
the opposite.  North will take you away, and south is still unknown.

The Nursery~
This room is covered with cacoon-like things hanging from the ceiling.
You watch in fascination as they open up dropping a small little black
creature, and within minutes the creature grows into a full grown monk
of Graghtok, each looking exactly like the rest.  At the rear of the
room are unique looking monks with symbols brandished into their
foreheads guarding a ladder leading up to a trap door.  North takes
you back.

tortmenting his followers.  A large bowl sits in the middle of the
table, filled with rotten meat.  Down takes you back to the Nursery.

with such material as "Blodgeoning For Pleasure".  Your attention is
drawn to one bookcase on the west wall in which is a large untouched
book.  An unpleasant musty smell fills your nose urging you to leave.

Dirty Hallway~
You find yourself walking through a hallway without any defined walls
or floor.  Instead, it looks more like a big hole dug into the earth.
It is hard to see ahead of you, and breathing is difficult due to the
inordinate amount of dust present in the air.  As you walk further in
you feel the temperature rise with every step.  Ahead of you you hear
footsteps and jarbled voices.  South leads you out of this hole, and
north takes you even deeper.

can see the mindless monks walking in a trance to their certain doom,
and you can see the elder monks overseeing them.  Even from this
height you can hear the sounds of the unearthly hounds enjoying their
assigned task.  You can no longer stand here and watch such a sight.
There are exits to the south and east.  South takes you out, and all
you know of east is that there is a lot of heat coming from that way.

This room is dedicated to the worship to the evil Graghtok, and that
alone.  In the center of the room is a collosal statue of the evil one
himself, and directly before that is an alter for the elder monks to
prove their devotion.  The ceiling in this room is not to be seen,
neither is a sky for that matter.  Just a big vast nothingness.  
Walking around the elephantine shrine, you can see a large steel door.

The heat from this room is almost too much to bare.  After adjusting a
little to the immense heat you look around.  There are no decorations
in this room in which to speak of.  Instead, there are piles of flesh
and bones, accompanied by the appropriate stench.  This is obviously
the room Graghtok choses for himself.  Maybe because of the heat,
maybe because of the solitude, but for whatever reason, you don't like
it.  The only exit from here is to the west.

you can see mages tossing fireballs about the room, these mages are
dressed in black robes and carry black bound scrolls with them, deadly
daggers drenched in poison adorn each hand of the black robe mages.  
Iron clad dwarves run about the room hacking at their enemies with
wild abandon.
