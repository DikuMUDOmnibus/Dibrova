A Small Altar in the Meadow~
The tall surrounding of the ancient forest have given way to a lush
meadow.  In the center of the meadow is a natural altar which is
covered in sweet smelling, colorful flowers.  The air is cool and
inviting and the entire area has a peaceful feeling about it.  A small
forest path leads south, back into the forest of tall majestic oaks.

The forest altar is circular in space and about six feet in diameter.
It sits close to three feet off the ground and is covered in sweet
smelling wildflowers in the colors of a rainbow.

An Illegal Logging Operation~
The air smells of freshly cut wood, and the constant sounds of
chopping fills the air where lovely songbirds once flourished among
the tall oak trees.  Laying on the ground, scattered between thick
stumps, are the scattered remains of the once majestic oak trees.

An Illegal Logging Operation~
Where once stood ancients oak trees, some hundreds of feet tall, now
remains a few broken limbs and chips of wood.  An occasional logger
catches sight of you, but quickly returns to work as they are on a
tight schedule.  Deep ruts from the carts used to carry away the
illegal haul are noticable all over the dirt ground.

Travelling Within the Oak Forest~
The forest is cool and inviting, although the massive oaks lining the
path still prevent you from leaving the path.  The path has a few deep
ruts from wagons that have been before you, but they do not slow you
down much.  Occasionally a small forest animal can be seen running
across the path from one side to the other.

The cabin is really nothing more than a small square of dried dirt,
with thick logs all around.  No windows are present and the only exit
that seems visible to the naked eyes would be the wooden door which is
located to the south.  A simple thatched roof of mud is above and
seems to be in poor shape.  A stone fireplace is against the back
wall, while twin wooden cots line the walls.

An Abandoned Saw Mill~
Back in the days before logging was outlawed, this mill would have
been a hive of activity.  A large paddle wheel can still be seen
outside the mill to the west, but has fallen and now restricts
movement in that direction.  The large wooden work tables are broken
and in many pieces all about the shop area.  The only thing within the
entire building that does not seem old and useless is a parchment
which has been tacked to a wall in the entrance to the mill.

paddle wheel~
This large wheel used to be turned by a creek outside the mill, thus giving
some amount of automated power to large cutting blades that were used to cut
the thick logs into usable lumber.  Now it is broken and serves as a reminder
that the entire mill is dead.    
~

parchment~
The parchment is written in red letters and seems to be new, unlike
everything else in the old mill.  The letters are large and very easy
to read:

     Logging has been outlawed in this area.  Anyone caught
     engaging in the milling of logs, or even cutting down 
     the trees in our beloved forest will be dealt with in
     accordance with our ancient laws and traditions.

In the Center of the Small Village~
A small, dirty looking well sits in the middle of the dirt path here,

wander by, some glancing at you briefly before moving along their way.
The entryway to the village's inn is directly north, and the old saw
mill lies to the west.  The dirt path which runs through the small
village goes east and south from here.

Inside a Small Log Cabin~
The cabin is really nothing more than a small square of dried dirt,
with thick logs all around.  No windows are present and the only exit
that seems visible to the naked eyes would be the wooden door which is
located to the north.  A simple thatched roof of mud is above and
seems to be in poor shape.  A stone fireplace is against the back
wall, while twin wooden cots line the walls.

A Dirt Path in the Oak Forest~
The forest vegetation, mainly consisting of wildflowers and shrubs,
does not hinder your wandering along the path.  Tall oak trees line
the sides of the path as if guiding you along to some unknown
destination.  The fresh air fills your being with a renewed vitality
as you venture into the forest.

Travelling Within the Oak Forest~
The forest is cool and inviting, although the massive oaks lining the
path still prevent you from leaving the path.  The path has a few deep
ruts from wagons that have been before you, but they do not slow you
down much.  Occasionally a small forest animal can be seen running
across the path from one side to the other.

Inside the Stables~
The stables of the small village are sparse and smell extremely bad.
The stables consist of six wooden stalls, filled with very brown hay
and a few tack and harness sets along the side walls.  A few sickly
mounts are here, but nothing that any serious adventurer would even be
seen on dead.

Tall oak trees, some hundred or so feet high, run along the sides of
the path.  Their massive and ancient trunks keeping you from leaving
the path.  The air is fresh and the smells of the wildflowers are a
welcome change.  The dirt path is worn from the constant use it must
get from others who venture into the forest.

A Cramped Tunnel Passage~
The cramped tunnel passage is barely large enough to fit one person at
a time and seems to have been carved directly out of solid rock.  The
dull grey walls are jagged and rough while pools of liquid have
gathered from the slow dripping of a strange green fluid.  The tunnel
leads into darkness to the east, while an opening to the outside world
is to the west.

The cave is small in size, but able to accomadate a few travellers
comfortably.  A small pyre in the center of the cave is surrounded by
a circle of small stones, and gives off a pleasant, but low light.  
The cave opening to the south is covered over by a small sheet of
water from the tall falls above, but is easy to traverse through.  
All in all, the cave would appear to be a safe and dry place to rest
for a short while.

The air is calm and peaceful here, and filled with the sweet scents of
the flowers which grow wild around the small pond below the waterfall.
The water looks cool and inviting after its short trip down the face
of the rocks to the north.  The water in the lower parts of the falls
comes in thin sheets, almost as if asking all to walk through its
refreshing shower.

colder and thinner, showing that one is high up in the mountains.  
The clashing of battling Bighorn sheep can be heard echoing throughout
the valleys as the Bald eagle soars high above in the sky.

Wildlife Refuge~
Random sized boulders decorate these hills, as short grasses and
low-lying shrubs grow in scattered pockets between them.  Small mounds
of dirt mark the places where a burrowing rodent has make its home.  
An occasional shriek of a hawk can be heard in the distance.

Wildlife Refuge~
Tall grasses wave to and fro with the breeze.  Daisies and other
wildflowers are in full bloom everywhere, lighting up the fields with
vivid patches of color.  An occasional thistle plant, armed with nasty
needles, dot the fields.  A small swarm of gnats drift by, as a
dragonfly darts about looking for prey.  An occasion waft of heat
comes from the south.

Wildlife Refuge~
Scores of scrubby cacti and succulent plants lie scattered about the
sandy landscape.  No water nor shade can be seen as the sun continues
to scorch the land.  Quiet rustlings can be heard as a Sidewinder
traverses the hot sands.  The breeze is non-existent, as the
sweltering heat dominates the area.
