A Dusty Trail~
You are heading along a dusty trail that runs toward the town ahead.
There is a horrid stench detectable even here.  You see a sign up
ahead.

The Town~
You have reached the Ghost Town, a place rumored to be inhabited by
the most ghastly of undead, as well as their fell minions.  Should you
proceed, you may find yourself unable to return home by conventional
means, and instead have to travel through until you find another means
of escape.  Your choice.

The Main Street~
Stepping onto this street, you immediately feel a wave of fear and
dread wash over you.  Shaking, you collect yourself and prepare to
advance into this literally god-forsaken area.  Houses line the street
to the left and right.  Up ahead lies a small town square.

Mayor of this town.  Since the incursion of the undead, it has fallen
into disrepair, though not to the state that the other dwellings have,
leading you to suspect that perhaps someone (or thing) important now
resides here...

den lined with shelves full of ancient texts.  A large oak desk
dominates the room, and behind this sits a plush leather chair.

In this room lies an ornately-carved four poster bed with satin
sheets.  Opposite it lies a comfortable divan, upon which the maidens
of the master of this domain usually recline.  A painting on one wall
catches your eye.

A Bedroom~
This bedroom is as ruinous as its northern counterpart was lavish, as
decayed and despoiled as it was well-presented and comfortable.  The
furniture, while obviously once fine, is now ruined beyond repair.  
Blood stains coat the walls, and a corpse hangs by a rope from the
chandelier in the center of the room.  Whoever lives here must have a
disagreeable personality to say the very least...

A Murky Mist~
You are plowing through a thick mist that has suddenly enshrouded the
trail.  You can still make it out beneath your feet, but only barely.
Howls, screams and shouts of anger and terror ring out on all sides,
and you feel fear clutching at your heart.

Outside The Crypt~
The small stone building is actually a crypt, which is in good
condition, not surprising considering the nature of the current
inhabitants of this ghoulish town.  A large iron door looms to the
east, and you notice runes inscribed into its surface in silver.

The runes on the door read-

  "Here is the final resting place of the Evil Baron Shereck, former
   tyrant of the Barony of Palem, and his two foul brothers. Imprisoned
   here by the powerful magic of Xanad, the ArchMage of Jareth, their
   rest may not be disturbed by their undead allies. Pray, whoever reads
   this, do not breach this portal, for you will once again unleash their
   undead madness upon the world."

Inside The Crypt~
The interior of the crypt is dark, damp and cramped.  It looks as
though no-one has been here in centuries.  A layer of dust ankle-deep
makes progress difficult, as do the hanging cobwebs, with strands as
thick as your wrist.  You hope you don't run into the spinner of these
webs.
