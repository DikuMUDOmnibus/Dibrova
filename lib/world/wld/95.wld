A Dusty Path~
This dusty path leads south directly into the Plains of Blood, a very
well known area of Dibrova for its evil creatures which roam thru its
wastes, stealing, ravaging, and killing as is their wont.  It is also
rumored that many wanted criminals who have fled the justice of the
cities have made their homes in that desolate waste, fighting anyone
who invades their territory and each other.  To the north lies the way
to Jareth, the farmlands, and more climate regions.

A Dusty Path~
The path has turned dusty as it gives way to the heated wastelands
south of here.  With every step south, the land seems to wither a bit
more, turning sad and desolate.  The Plains of Blood, they call them.
The place where only the desperate or the brave - or the foolish - go.
North of this area the greener pastures of Jareth's farmlands begin to
give way.

Path to the Southern Wastes~
To the south the farmlands are completely swallowed by a vast plain of
dirty brown heat, shimmering from the waves of intense heat rolling in
torrents from the scalded ground.  Just north of here is the Western
Road which leads directly into Jareth or through the farmlands.

of the graveyard.  You may head east back toward the way you came or

The Plains of Blood~
You are walking across the plains of blood, a blasted, desolate area
so named for the incredible amounts of blood that poured from the
bodies of slain men and orcs during the Goblin Wars many centuries
ago.  And although the hordes were driven back, this area remained
tainted with the scourge of evil, and little that is non wholly
diabolical has since flourished here.  A path leads north toward a
far-off city and signs of greenery.

Going is rough here as you are constantly forced to skirt rocks,
boulders and bits of jagged stone that jut out of the ground at
potentially lethal angles.  The "path" you are currently taking is
simply the one of least difficulty, avoiding all the major
obstructions and clambering over the minor ones.  More than one you
slip and skin your hands and knees, and you pray that you don't have
much farther to go.

You have entered the sickly-looking forest you spied earlier, and it
looks even worse up close, if that is at all possible.  Long, clinging
vines slowly strangle the life out of spindly half-dead saplings, and
a strange blue moss slowly eats away its protruding roots.  Far away a
creature screams in agony, then falls silent.

As you proceed further into this place, the little light that was
coming from the feeble sun above is dimmed to near-nothingness by a
thick canopy of dead branches and leaves that has formed overhead.  
Sap drips from this canopy onto you, burning your skin where it hits,
and you hurry on.
