Inside a Small Earthen Cave~
This is a small windy cave near the top of a mountain located far away
from civilization.  From within, you hear deep guttural sounds of some
creature muttering to itself.  In addition, there are deep grunting
sounds, wild howls, hysterical laughter, and other wierd sounds.  A
small path leads away from the cave south.

similar to the one you heard when you were lingering outside this raw
earth cave some time ago.  With each howling windy emanating from the

is slick with ice and you cannot find a good firm hold onto the
surrounding walls to anchor yourself by.  You desperately try to find
a way out of this predicament, but you only find despair and lost
hope.

air as cold as ice.  Small icicles and sheets of ice cling to the

You wander through a corridor of pure ice.  The corridor is large and
roomy.  Decorative geometric motifs were carved into the walls and
ceiling in an attempt to beautify the tunnel.  Despite the interesting
surroundings, you notice it is deadly cold down here.  A few minutes
of relative inactivity can render a creature of flesh and bone into a
frozen carcass.  This corridor continues north and east.

A Frozen Ice Corridor~
This is a corridor of ice you find yourself in.  Pretty geometric
motifs were carved into the walls and ceiling.  The floor is smooth
and level, and has a polished sheen to it.  In the air, the sounds of
ice clicking on ice can be heard; they sound like footsteps.  This
corridor continues north and west.

A Frozen Ice Cave~
This is a wonderland of ice.  Pretty geometric motifs, carved into the
walls and ceiling, decorate this cave.  The smooth icy floor had been
parqueted with tiles of ice, carved and fitted into place.  It seems
like a place befitting a king.  You notice a magical brillance
emanating from the east.  This cave continues east, south, and west.

The Throne Room of Ice~
You enter a large cathedral-like space.  The room sparkles with a
fiery brillance as magical light, contained in icy cressets, reflect
and refract off the many multi-faceted walls.  High above, the ceiling
disappears into gloomy darkness.  In this room sits a large throne
placed on a dais of ice.  Despite the deadly cold, you stop shivering
for one moment as you stand in awe of your surroundings.  The throne
room exits west.

Small ledge~
You stand on a small ledge on the side of the mountain.  Looking west
and to the north you can make out a large city, placed against the
Black mountain range.  To the east a small rugged path leads to a dark
opening.
