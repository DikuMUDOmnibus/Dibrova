A Smelly Cow Shop~
You stand in a small wooden shop lined wall to wall with shelves full
of potions.  The potions buzz and fizzle as you look through them.  
Unlike most other shops in Dibrova, this shop will buy potions of all
kinds, for less than they are worth, of course.  The only exit is to
the south.
