NOT DONE:
Finish demon quest (Greyfeather)
Locate Object (code is checking first alias'd word on obj, not the word
               spec'd by caster)
Retrieve Corpse (doesnt recognize if player in room)

Add weapon types in olc (Kaan, need list from Greyfeather)
 -- All zones will have to be oedit saved, then the code updated.
 -- Lotsa new macros at the end of utils.h
 -- The Types:
   -- "cloth",
   -- "leather",
   -- "copper",
   -- "iron",
   -- "steel",
   -- "silver",
   -- "magical", 
 -- New obj file spares
 -- As of 12-27-01, it saves and reads from a file, all objs have been updated.
    As of yet, the code has no effect in the game.
